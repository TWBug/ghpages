professional network in taiwan?   how to broaden your professional network in taiwan?  finding work or starting a business in taiwan is challenging, and to succeed you need all the guanxi (關係) that you can get. you need access to people who have done it before, can highlight pitfalls and obstacles, and are willing to offer a little friendly advice. this is what creating good connections, or guanxi, is all about.below is a culmination of tips on how to take the first steps toward building a network of connections, both international and local, that will impact you professionally and personally. finding the right network is crucial for your career in taiwan, and we hope that this article will aid you on your journey to broadening your professional network.   close            tip 1: be honest about your intentions  be honest about what outcomes you want to achieve long term, and be clear and upfront about your goals for networking.whether you are seeking internships, mentors, business advice, visa advice, potential business prospects, or a new career, it&amp;rsquo;s best to be direct about your intentions from the start. be honest with yourself first, so you can be sincere to those in your network.   close            tip 2: make a list of the types of people you want to meet  your time is finite, and so is the time of people you connect with. networking requires time, effort, and planning, so try to identify the types of people you would like to focus your networking on.think about potential hiring managers, specific vc’s, other senior leaders or experts in your desired field. growing your network in terms of relevant quality is better than growing it in terms of random quantity.for instance, as a job seeker, identify the companies that you would like to work for, that align with your values, and where you can see yourself growing professionally. take a look at job postings on job boards (or even facebook) and start cross-referencing hr staff on linkedin, if you’d like to directly enquire about relevant opportunities.   close            tip 3: utilize linkedin  linkedin is one of the most important social media platforms for professionals in taiwan, especially for those new to taiwan. in addition, although professional communities and networks thrive on facebook, it is not recommended to approach contacts of interest on facebook. conversely, on linkedin, adding connections of interest who you have had no previous contact with is permissible.being active on the platform is paramount to expanding your professional network in an efficient and organized manner. make sure that your linkedin profile is complete and professional. try referring to the profiles of the people you are interested in, this will make you think critically about the first impressions you are projecting, and whether your profile represents you in an accurate and professional manner.for the purposes of compiling a shortlist, use the ‘connections’ button and click search with filters. if you are looking to start a business, search for founders and ceos in your desired industry, who work in fields and areas closely related to yours. on the other hand, as a job seeker you can search for the profiles of hiring managers at the companies you are interested in. search for relevant professional groups and keep an eye out for online and offline events.next, you can invite connections with a short note like this:‘hi xxxx, thanks for the connection, i am looking for xxxx and was wondering if i could ask for a moment of your time to discuss xxxx.’   close            tip 4: make time for coffee  when you have established the connection and the conversation is flowing online, try to organize an in-person coffee, or at least an online chat. for good guanxi, it is important to seem like a genuine human being, so aim to have a conversation in person so that you can create a good impression.message the contact to see where is convenient for them, and whether they recommend any cafe or restaurant nearby. be clear to yourself and the other person about the goal of the meeting. make sure you do not waste the other person’s time for your own benefit. good professional networks are small and bad reputations spread fast.   close            tip 5: ask nicely and listen  there are no special techniques to professional networking that you can’t learn or draw from every day socializing. some people feel that in order to seem professionally attractive, they must present an idealized version of themselves. however, this may backfire and make you seem disingenuous and projecting a fake image. do not try to be something you are not. relax and actively listen to whoever you are connecting with. not only is this an easier way to communicate, but it also maximizes your chances of discovering genuine alignment and connection.note that networking does not work well when you directly ask your connections for a job or help. stating your intention for a meeting is quite different from asking for something that you’re unsure that connection can give. being too direct may come off as being too pushy, or even worse, obviously treating that person as a means to an end.a good professional impression of yourself should not be of desperation, but of someone who genuinely wants to engage as a human being, and also is keen to offer rather than just take. if you have some skill or resource that might be of value to them, it never hurts to offer something in return, this way you are extending an exchange of value, even if that person declines your offer.try asking whether they know of resources or people that may be able to help, or relate and ask whether they have experienced your current challenges. make it a dialogue and ask for their opinion and advice, instead of requesting that they help.   close            tip 6: follow up and play the long game  the only way to maintain a connection is by following up. if you are struggling with conversation, focus on referencing a specific topic from your conversation before and offer help and advice. the best professional connections are made by being nice, offering something in return and not asking for too much. don’t give the impression that you are going to discard a connection once you have taken what you need at the time.don’t just collect connections and then look them up when you really need something. like any relationship, professional connections need care and attention, or the relationship will simply wither and die. it is rare that you immediately gain something from meeting people for the first time, so manage your expectations. time needs to be spent fostering relationships for the long term, not just for your most immediate need or crisis.remember, whoever you meet out there professionally, don’t forget to ask their advice on what connections may be useful, what events are out there, etc.the next step is to get yourself out there.written by daniel miller, co-founder of all hands taiwan and taiwan manager for pagoda projects."},{"index":"2","summary":"how to choose professional networking events in taipei?   how to choose professional networking

to set up an association in taiwan - a case study  if one of your entrepreneurial goals in taiwan is to set up an entity resembling a non-profit organization (ngo), a charity, or a non-profit social enterprise, one option is to form an association. one of the main reasons to open an association is to accept donations from corporate partners and reduce the obstacles to working with governmental organizations and other ngos. if you’re interested in learning what it takes to create an association, this article is for you.   close            the right accountant is crucial  it can take over a year to finalize an association if you choose the wrong accountant, when it really shouldn’t take longer than six months. it really comes down to the accountant you choose, so pick one who comes highly recommended by friends who have already opened their own companies. unfortunately, a lot of accountants don’t have any actual experience in setting up an association, but may tell you that they can do it. instead of wasting your time, find someone with a proven track record of establishing an association.   close            choose a home for your organization  the accountant will ask if you want to incorporate in all of taiwan or just taipei.incorporating as a city-based association in taipei is a much easier process, and is the recommended option. by setting up in taipei, you only need to prove that you have members in the taipei area.to incorporate as a nationwide association, you need to prove that you have members all over taiwan. if you’re considering founding an association, it is strongly recommended that you talk to people who have done it before to get an understanding of the membership workloads, because they are considerable.   close            bring your crew  once you have established a location for your organization, the next step is to gather the signatures of your members. to be efficient, decide to gather close friends and your close network with an aligned mission. this is critically important.in order to legally establish an association in taipei, you need to have at least 30 members willing to sign membership forms and who are in one of the following situations: taiwanese with their household registration in taipei, foreigners with an arc (alien resident certificate) that shows that they live in taipei, or taiwanese or foreigners who don’t live in taipei but work there (which can be proven with a letter from their employer).  if a member lives in taipei or has their household registration in taipei, things are pretty easy; their address is printed on their taiwanese id, so that can be shown as proof of residence. however, if a member only works in taipei, then they need to ask their employer to sign a letter affirming their employment within taipei. each member also has to sign a membership form and provide photos of their id cards.on top of collecting the paperwork above, you need to require these members to attend two official meetings and sign-in at each meeting.for example, you can cater two events where your plans and vision for the association can be shared with new members and at the same time, collect their signatures. at least 50% of the members needs to attend each meeting, so it can become a little troublesome to get busy professionals in taipei to adjust their schedules.another key issue is that after its initial founding, a taipei association needs to continue to hold two general member meetings every six months.in addition to compiling the association membership, the organization must select a group of board members and a group of audit committee members. the board is meant to be an advisory committee that can offer guidance and decision-making support to the organization and its initiatives, while the audit committee supervises the board and ensures the organization and its finances are in good standing.if all of this sounds a bit complicated, you can peruse the relevant documentation in chinese  , or ask your accountant to help you get set up.   close              close            pay the man  with government filings in order, it is finally time to pay your hard-working accountant, which amounts to around ntd$120,000 for the set up and registration process. one other fee to consider is your mailing address. to set up an organization, you need to register a mailing address. if you have an office, you’re already set. however, if your organization is fully remote, you can elect to pay around nt $3,000 / month to rent an office space from a co-working space or business center.monthly accounting services will probably cost around nt $ 3,000 – nt $ 4,000 per month.all in all, expenses should be around ntd$120,000 &#43; ntd$36,000 = ntd$156,000 for a first year of administration, but of course fees will vary according to each organization.   close            adventures in taiwanese banking  the next logical step entails opening a bank account. there’s no legal requirement regulating which bank an association must choose, but e. sun bank has an english-friendly website, and is the only bank that paypal funds can be transferred to in taiwan. with newly-minted association documents and chop seals in hand, you can go to your bank of choice and open the association bank account. the bank account must be opened at the bank branch closest to your association office address. please note that this is a fairly minor consideration, as later you can bank at any branch, but when setting up your accounts, be prepared to visit the branch nearest your registered address.   close            welcome to the goody room  now that your association is legally established, you can apply for deals that are only available to non-profit organizations. a lot of deals with foreign tech companies can be found via techsoup taiwan  . create a profile, upload your association founding documents, and after verification by techsoup taiwan, you can register to get slack pro, google workspace, and other services for free for your org, while also gaining access to discount offers from zoom and other services. while this should not be a motivation for setting up the association, it is certainly nice to get some goodies back for all the effort.this article was reviewed by the accountants at del sol cpa &amp;amp; associates 德碩會計師事務所.written by daniel

in 2007, the high-speed rail has become the fastest means of transportation in taiwan, with stations located in 11 major cities, including taipei, taoyuan, hsinchu, taichung, tainan and kaohsiung. reaching high speeds of 300 kilometers per hour, it only takes 95 minutes to travel between taipei and kaohsiung. tourists can wake up early, take the hsr from taipei and arrive in kaohsiung before noon, then take the kaohsiung mrt and ferry to qijin fishing port to enjoy some fresh seafood. if there’s time, on the way back through taichung take a stroll through the famous feng chia night market for some more tasty delicacies. after eating and drinking your fill, you are ready to head home with a full belly and great memories.  encino from zhwiki, public domain, via wikimedia commons    close             ticketing info     taiwan railway  the long history of the taiwan railway is a common memory for many taiwanese people. though it may be slower than the hsr, the taiwan railway is an island-wide network that connects different cities and counties in the western and eastern regions of taiwan. with 241 stations and relatively inexpensive fares, it remains one of the most convenient and popular forms of public transportation, especially during the holidays when many locals need to return home.the taiwan railways&#39; train ride around the island is a very popular attraction. tourists can witness the splendid views of taiwan&amp;rsquo;s cities and admire the beautiful scenery of its countryside, all from the comfort of their well-designed and spacious train. the most charming part of the ride is the east rift valley (also known as the huadong valley). during the spring, tourists are treated to a sea of wild flowers scattered across the mountainside; in the autumn during harvest season, they can witness an abundance of wheat ears, glistening under the sun. regardless of what season it is, the thriving and vibrant life of taiwan’s countryside is apparent. for tourists who wish to travel on the taiwan railway during long holidays, especially the eastern route trains, please remember to book your tickets in advance as tickets sell out fast!   close             ticketing info     charter bus system  taiwan&amp;rsquo;s charter bus system is also very well-developed, with prices cheaper than the taiwan railway. however, unlike the taiwan railway, aside from a few major metropolitan areas, most stops are located near highway interchanges, far from the city. therefore, if you decide to take a charter bus, it is likely that you will need to arrange for another ride later.currently, there are many charter bus companies in taiwan, such as kuo-kuang ebus, united highway bus (ubus), ho-hsin ebus, kamalan bus, hsinchu bus, etc. it may be daunting at first for foreigners to determine which bus company best fits their need, but just remember that aside from kuo-kuang ebus, each bus company has specific cities in which they operate, so the easiest way to decide is to choose from the departure and arrival cities. in order to promote tourism and remedy the insufficiencies of the existing highway charter bus system, the tourism bureau of the ministry of transportation and communications of taiwan launched the taiwan tourist shuttle bus service in 2010 to shuttle passengers to and from nearby major taiwan railway and hsr stations. as long as you time it right, you can almost always catch a ride, making it one of the most popular means of transportation for backpackers.  from tourism bureau    close             list of charter bus

kaohsiung, taoyuan, new taipei and taichung, listed in order of their establishment. if the mrt is your main mode of transportation, it is more cost-effective to purchase a monthly pass. in addition, to ensure the comfort of passengers and keep the mrt cars clean, no food or drink is allowed in the station or on the trains. the taipei mass rapid transit, branded as the taipei metro, was the first mrt to be established in taiwan, and has since developed six different lines covering almost the entire taipei metropolitan area, allowing many landmarks and popular attractions to be accessible by mrt. the furthest north you can travel by mrt is danshui, the south is xindian bitan, the west to xinzhuang or tucheng, and the east to nangang, where the first professional large-scale, double-story exhibition hall in taiwan is located - the go-to venue for many major international exhibitions. with such a well-connected network and trains that almost are never delayed, the taipei metro definitely ranks as one of the top metro systems internationally.the kaohsiung mrt was officially opened in 2008, and currently has three main lines: the red line, the orange line, and the circular light rail line. it also connects the zuoying station in the north to the kaohsiung international airport in the south. well-known stations include formosa boulevard, weiwuying, central park, and sizihwan. formosa boulevard station is renowned for its beautiful &amp;ldquo;dome of light&amp;rdquo; stained glass art display, the world’s largest public art installation made from pieces of colored glass. in addition to the 3 lines mentioned, the kaohsiung mrt continues to propose plans to increase the number of lines and stations, moving towards the ideal of a 30-minute living circle in greater kaohsiung.the taoyuan mrt is the third mrt system in operation, with network that covers three cities: taipei city, new taipei city and taoyuan city. the airport mrt is connected to the taipei metro, making it easy for inbound and outbound passengers to get to taipei in about 30 minutes by direct train.the new taipei and taichung mrt systems were opened later. the new taipei mrt is mainly operated by thetaipei metro corporation, and consists of the danhai light rail, ankeng light rail, and sanying line. currently, only the danhai light rail is in operation. the taichung mrt consists of the green, blue, and orange line, with only the green line (wurih-wunsin-beitun line) currently being in operation, and connects the taichung hsr station with city hall.   close             taipei metro

transportation in all cities. many people choose city buses as their main means of transportation because of their frequency, convenience, and number of stops.all counties and cities in taiwan have a city bus system, with taipei, taichung, tainan and kaohsiung having the most developed and concentrated bus routes. in order to encourage the public to take the bus more often, each county and city offers special discount programs from time to time, such as taichung’s double 10 bus fare scheme, and the taipei fun pass, so you can travel the entire city without having to drive yourself.your easycard is accepted on the city bus so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to pay with change.   close             taipei city bus info    taichung city bus info    tainan city bus info    kaohsiung city bus info     public bicycles (you-bike/e-bike/city bike/ ibike/ t-bike)  public bicycles have frequently been seen as a way to solve the “last mile” problem, and connect users between public transit networks and their final destination. since 2008, taipei and other major cities have been promoting public bicycles and setting up more docking stations to conserve energy, reduce the city’s carbon footprint, and encourage a healthy lifestyle with exercise.due to the increase of cyclists, the city has gradually begun to change its traffic system to ensure cyclists’ safety and right-of-way. for example, taipei city has reduced car lanes just to make room for more bike lanes. currently, most of the major public bicycles in the country are manufactured by giant, taiwan&amp;rsquo;s number one bicycle brand. some regions even entrust giant to operate their bicycles. the design of the bike is very user-friendly, complete with wide seats and 3-speed gear shift. the ability to pay with an easycard (or other similar cards), makes it very convenient and highly praised.  ltdccba, cc by-sa 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0  , via wikimedia commons    close

such as phoning for one, using an app, or just stopping one on the street. in addition to the common taxi companies such as taiwan taxi and metro taxi, in recent years, technological innovation and

taiwan  social etiquette is very important for people in taiwan. they pay special attention to be respectful in social interaction whether it be their words or deeds. here are some basic business etiquette to guarantee you smooth sailing in business settings or with friends and family. greetings     close            names and titles are very important and it is customary to exchange business cards upon introduction. keep extra business cards in your wallet at all times, and it&amp;rsquo;s best to have cards with both chinese and english. after shaking hands, present your business card with both hands to the other person. do not throw your card on the table and always try to give a card if you receive one. a nod or a slight bow is considered polite for the first meeting, while handshakes are generally only for males who are friends. introductions are important. always wait for a third person to introduce you. if at a party or business meeting, wait for the host to introduce you. punctuality is appreciated, but being a few minutes early or late is acceptable. many greetings include the question, “have you eaten?” as a polite inquiry.   meetings     close            business people in taiwan are hard bargainers and may try to gain concessions by wearing the other party down. be patient and do not push too hard or fast. if possible, bring a team of 2-4 people (one senior individual with decision-making power). this enhances the status and image of executives and reflects on the seriousness of the meeting. decisions are made collectively and can be a lengthy process during negotiation. once facts are established, agreements can sometimes be reached quickly. 關係 or guan-xi means connections/personal relationships. guan-xi is vital for business success in taiwan. taiwanese business people will want to know you personally before they do business with you.   dining and entertainment     close            to be successful in taiwan, one must master the art of entertaining. entertaining should never be regarded as a waste of time and choosing the right restaurant is vital and can greatly enhance your chances of success. dining in taiwan can be elaborate and exhausting with as many as twenty courses at a banquet, meaning that business dinners can go late into the night. be sure to arrive on time or early for a banquet. do not discuss business at dinner unless your hosts bring it up. toasting is common and is often made before and during meals. toasting is done with wine or liquor. the host begins by raising their glass with two hands, with one hand supporting the bottom of the glass. if your taiwan host wishes to toast with you and passes you an empty glass, rest assured that it will be filled by one of the hosts. you are expected to toast your host and drink the contents of the glass. the guest of honor is the first to sample any dish brought to the table. be sure to taste the food immediately as everyone else will wait for you to finish before they eat. the host will place food on the guests&#39; plates. each person can help themselves to any additional food by placing a small amount of food from a variety of dishes into their individual rice bowl. place your rice bowl close to your face while eating, but leave plates on the table. place your chopsticks together on the table or on the chopstick rest when you are finished. never stick your chopsticks vertically into a bowl. never place bones or seeds in your rice bowl. if a plate is not provided for this purpose, place them on the table. the host (person who has invited everyone) always pays the bill. it is polite for the guest to offer to pay, but don&amp;rsquo;t insist.   attire     close            the taiwanese place a heavy emphasis on dressing neatly and conservatively. men tend to wear suits, while women wear conservative business attire, such as a loose skirt and blouse. making a good first impression is vital. avoid wearing t-shirts, jeans, and other casual attire to first meetings. even while attending a casual activity, you should dress modestly. your clothing should be neat, clean, and unwrinkled.   gifts     close            present and receive gifts with both hands and do not open them in front of the giver. recipients may refuse a gift to be polite, but politely persist until the gift is accepted. custom requires people to reciprocate with a gift of equal value. gifts should be wrapped with great care, and the container and wrapping of the gift is as important as the gift itself.   body language     close            do not touch anyone, especially a baby, on the top of their head. affection for the opposite sex is not shown in public. never use your feet to move an object or to point as feet are considered dirty. place your hands in your lap when sitting. men should not cross their legs, but rather place both feet on the floor. putting an arm around someone&amp;rsquo;s shoulder, winking, and pointing with your index finger are all considered rude gestures. you may point with an open hand. palms facing outward and in front of the face moving back and forth means &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;. nervous movements, such as tapping your foot, are considered rude. accept food and other objects with both hands to indicate respect. be humble if you receive a compliment. family is central in taiwanese culture, so it is polite to inquire about someone’s family.

professionals to face some obstacles when adjusting to local workplace culture. whether you are beginning a new job in a taiwanese company, starting your own company, or simply engaging with businesses in taiwan on a professional level, this article aims to explain four of the most common cultural distinctions that define a taiwanese workplace.   giving feedback       close           workplaces in different cultures are uniquely nuanced in the ways they communicate feedback—positive or negative. what stands out in a taiwanese workplace? non-confrontation.taiwan is a non-confrontational culture, so a direct and opinionated approach may fall short with colleagues and management. negative comments or criticisms between colleagues, particularly between a manager and subordinates, can be awkward and embarrassing for everyone involved. avoid giving negative feedback in front of a large group of people at all costs. this is where the concept of “face” is especially important, and any interaction that results in a colleague or business partner losing face can irreversibly damage relations.this cultural nuance requires that an individual have a firm grasp of the context in which things are said: be sensitive to your tone, your words, and your seniority. for instance, criticism of others, however constructive, is a major faux-pas in team meetings in taiwan. this can easily be misconstrued as an attempt to humiliate a colleague in front of the rest of the team and draw positive attention to yourself. however, praise in front of a large group of people is certainly welcomed.you will more often experience criticism or feedback being expressed via text or email. while this can be a means to avoid confrontation in the short term, it is recommended that a face-to-face discussion is arranged asap in order to avoid potential longer-term misunderstandings. tersely written arguments can be interpreted in a different way than intended, so it is in your interest to clearly communicate feedback or criticism in person. furthermore, in-person communication provides you the platform to explain again (and again!) if you can see there is a misunderstanding.  handling hierarchy       close           intimately related to the above concept of “face” is the notion of hierarchy within a workplace—your position and the relative position of the individual you are communicating with determines how a message is received.if you are part of a local team, it is important to understand that if someone senior to you gives you a task, you are expected to carry out the task exactly as instructed. another common misstep that foreign professionals in taiwan are prone to is sharing an opinion or suggestion for improvement to a line manager. if you do this too early in your relationship, it could be interpreted as criticism or even arrogance.seniority is to be respected and abided by. in addition, when hierarchical systems are present in a workplace, it can cause an employee to feel that they are being micromanaged, or that obedience is expected above all else. thus, keeping a strong and even personal relationship with your boss is key to long-term success within a company—it is important to give the impression that you are an ally.on the other hand, if you are doing business with a taiwanese company, it is in your best interest to find the person who can make executive decisions, as it may feel like communicating with someone lower down the hierarchy can delay communication. establish a connection, or guanxi, with someone who has the power to make decisions as soon as possible.  guanxi       close           echoing the point made above about being liked by your boss, establishing deeper connections will contribute to longer-term professional success. guanxi loosely translates as personal connections, relationships, or social networks. having good, bad, or no guanxi impacts one’s influence and ability to get things done.being liked by all levels of a hierarchy will help you succeed. although this point can be applied universally, in taiwan it is especially true that a feel-good personal relationship can blossom into a fruitful professional relationship. this is not to say that you have to become close friends with all of your colleagues, but showing interest in their personal lives and building rapport is an excellent way to cultivate trust.take some time to get to know your colleagues around you—you may notice quite personal questions being asked of you, but this is an indication that someone wants to establish deeper guanxi. try to avoid gossip and controversial topics when you can, as impressions and reputations travel far and especially fast. offering gifts is a common part of showing appreciation and respect to your colleagues, so prepare to bring something back if you go on a trip or a vacation.  structure over flexibility       close           during the pandemic, it has become increasingly apparent that some established practices in taiwanese work culture have been slow to change and are quite conservative compared to many companies globally. one such aspect is a lack of flexibility in work culture, and managers are often unable to trust their employees to work effectively from home, or according to their own patterns and methods. seen another way, taiwanese work culture can be seen as being entrenched in a culture of presenteeism, which means that employees must show up for 8 hours in the office (or more!) in order to be recognized for their efforts. this is one major adjustment that foreign professionals in taiwan must adapt to. productivity is measured in hours that one is present and supervised, and the prevalence of kpis as a common performance metric is a reflection of this. as such, employee output and capability can sometimes be skewed by physical attendance. consequently, such work practices can seem outdated, and one should not expect an open space in which your suggestions for better work-life balance will be welcomed.conversely, if you are aiming to start your own company and retain top talent, it may be a good idea to offer a flexible work culture that suits each individual&amp;rsquo;s desired work-life balance—consider work-from-home days and encourage workplace discussions on how to foster a collaborative work environment. of course, there are many ways to organize a work culture, but the key consideration is the employee’s wellbeing. if that is taken care of, creativity and productivity naturally follow.written by daniel

traditional festivals in taiwan  wondering what common traditions and customs there are on this beautiful island? if you’re not familiar with taiwan, keep reading as we introduce the top six traditional festivals in taiwan and their respective customs. before you know it, you will be an expert on taiwanese culture! spring festival (chinese new year or lunar new year)  spring festival is the most important festival and the longest national holiday in taiwan, beginning on december 30th (new year&amp;rsquo;s eve) and ending on the fourth day of the first month of the lunar calendar. on the western calendar, the dates fall around mid-january to mid-february.   close           there are many traditional customs that must be observed during spring festival, and each custom has its own symbolic meaning. one custom that almost every family observes is setting off firecrackers to drive away nian. according to ancient chinese folklore, every new year&amp;rsquo;s eve, the beast, nian, would come out of hiding and wreak havoc in the villages looking for food. the villagers knew that the beast feared the color red and loud noises, so everyone would put red lanterns and spring couplets on their doors and set off firecrackers to deter the beast and scare it away.   close           on new year&amp;rsquo;s eve, the entire family will clean the house together to welcome in the new year; as the saying goes, “out with the old, in with the new!” after the cleaning is done, the family will put spring couplets on the door for good luck. at night, the entire family will gather and enjoy new year&amp;rsquo;s eve dinner. the most common dishes that must be eaten are: fish, special vegetables, dumplings, turnip cake, buddha jumps over the wall, etc. each dish is very elaborate and has a special meaning, for example, the chinese pronunciation for the word “fish” sounds exactly like the word for “abundance”, thus, eating fish symbolizes that you will have a year of abundance. traditionally, families must not finish the fish entirely, as some must be left for next year. turnip cakes are also a very popular dish because the word “cake” sounds like the word for “high”, symbolizing good luck and a promotion. lastly, dumplings are shaped like ancient chinese currency (yuanbao), so eating them signifies attracting wealth and treasure.   close           on the first day of the lunar new year, you must get up early to set off firecrackers, then pay your respects to your friends and relatives by visiting them at home. you are not allowed to sweep the floor or take out the trash because you risk sweeping away your good fortune. if you accidently break something, you must say suì suì píng ān, which means, may you have peace all year round.the second day of the lunar new year is reserved for visiting the in-laws on the wife’s side of the family. traditionally, when a woman is married, she must live with her husband and his family. on the second day, the husband accompanies his wife to her parents&#39; home for a family reunion, to visit friends and relatives, and to maintain relations.of all the customs that are observed during the spring festival, the most popular among both children and adults is the tradition of red envelopes; also known as new year’s money or directly translated, “money for suppressing age”. the pronunciation of the chinese word “age” and the word for “evil spirits” are the same, therefore, receiving this money indicates suppressing evil spirits and bad luck. nowadays, it has evolved into the delivery of blessings and good luck to anyone who receives a red envelope. lantern festival  the lantern festival happens on the first full moon of the lunar new year. traditional customs include carrying paper lanterns, solving riddles written on lanterns and eating tangyuan (glutinous rice balls stuffed with sweet paste made from red bean, sesame, or peanut butter). there are many different lantern festivals all over taiwan, each with their own respective customs depending on the region and where you are located.   close            pingxi sky lantern festival: every year, both locals and tourists travel to pingxi to write their prayers or wishes for the coming year on a sky lantern and watch as it slowly floats up to their ancestors and gods in the heavens. watching as all the lanterns slowly rise and light up
