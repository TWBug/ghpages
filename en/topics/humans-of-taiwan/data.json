[{"index":"0","summary":"from corporate germany to corporate taiwan - a different perspective   from corporate germany to corporate taiwan - a different perspective  this time around, the taiwan employment gold card office sits down with muhammed özcan, director of global quality at the international taiwanese company excellence opto, inc. (eoi). we were super excited to hear about his experiences working in corporate and the automotive industry in germany and taiwan. introduce yourself!  my name is muhammed özcan. i am german; i was born in germany as the son of turkish immigrants and will soon be 45 years old. my wife also has a similar background. we have two children, one is 16, and the other is 3 years old. my family and i moved to taiwan from lippstadt, germany, in april 2020; my family arrived 2 months later. since then, we have been living in zhubei, hsinchu county.i work for excellence opto, inc. (eoi), an international taiwanese company in the automotive industry. eoi manufactures and develops leds and printed circuit boards. eoi&amp;rsquo;s customers include tesla, ford, audi, bmw, mercedes benz, gm, volkswagen, toyota, nissan, skoda, baic group, etc. the headquarters is in taiwan. i am currently director of global quality &amp;amp; member of the management board.   close            was taiwan your first experience living abroad and getting introduced to asian culture?  i grew up with japanese culture because i have a black belt in karate. i started this martial art when i was 8 years old. later at university, i worked in a chinese restaurant. all my coworkers were chinese, and i also picked up a little chinese. that was a lot of fun.10 years ago, i had the opportunity to go to beijing for 2 years with my employer at the time, hella. that was my first experience going abroad, and it was a big culture shock. at that time, i was doing similar work to what i am doing now. before i moved here, i traveled around asia a lot and had seen taiwan before covid. how does your experience in beijing differ from taiwan?  at that time, i was a classic expat with a contract of 2 years. i also did not bring my family with me. every 6 weeks, i would fly to germany to spend time with them. this time my employment is a bit different. i was hired locally, and i am in for the long haul. what brought you to taiwan?  i came because eoi offered me the opportunity to work for them as director of global quality. the whole package was great. salary, opportunities&amp;hellip; but most importantly, with the role i&amp;rsquo;ve been given, i have the decision-making power to make a difference. i can use all my knowledge and experience to influence the company&amp;rsquo;s future and hopefully create a better future. that is one of the main reasons why i was hired and why i accepted the offer.at my previous company in germany, i was already able to accomplish a lot. but here, i can really see the impact my work has.before i accepted this position, i brought my family to visit and check out my potential future company. we also used the time to go sightseeing, look at housing and international schools, and understand the living conditions and lifestyle. we wanted to make sure we made an informed decision before we moved.we decided pretty quickly that this was the right choice because the living conditions were not very different from what we were used to in germany.   close            why the taiwan employment gold card?  the hr team at my company did a great job researching all the visa options for me in advance. they presented the gold card as the best possible option for me, and i agreed. the fact that it is an all-in-one visa and that it offered me tax benefits was amazing. afterward, my hr team helped me with the whole application process; i just had to give them all the necessary paperwork. how&amp;rsquo;s the work environment compared to germany?  well, i used to have a 35-hour workweek (laughs). i definitely work a lot more here, which puts a lot more housework on my wife. people here work much harder and much longer.of course, i can&amp;rsquo;t speak for all businesses, but based on my conversations with friends in taiwan who work in all sizes of businesses, it appears that digitization is not as advanced as it is in germany. as a result, people often have to work harder to compensate. i believe taiwan still has a long way to go in terms of digitalization in the workplace. but that also offers a lot of opportunities for new possibilities.specifically for my work, the processes in germany take much longer. that&amp;rsquo;s because many work processes are more detailed and in-depth. here, people try to get the work done as quickly as possible, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t always allow for that depth.one of the things that struck me was the respect for work hierarchies. it is important for companies here, whereas people usually don&amp;rsquo;t care that much about it in germany. my position allows me a lot of decision-making power, but i often have to discuss a lot with my superiors to come to a conclusion. what are your biggest challenges?  something i wasn&amp;rsquo;t really prepared for was also the different mentalities i have to deal with, mainly because of my position. my job is to bring improvements to the company and find solutions to problems. since i&amp;rsquo;m based at headquarters, i have to deal with employees in china and the u.s., which can be quite a challenge at times.however, one of my biggest challenges is the language barrier. i have some basic knowledge of mandarin, but it&amp;rsquo;s not really enough. it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily very easy; most of our meetings are in chinese, and i have to make sure i find a way to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on. there are many technical tools that help with this, sometimes i ask my colleagues to help me translate, or someone on my team helps me take meeting minutes. luckily, some of my team members can speak english well.our ceo is amazing. she spent a long time in the states, so she speaks perfect english, definitely better than me laughs. she helps and supports me a lot. she translates and makes sure i stay up to date.but the language barrier is a big challenge, i must say. i would like to change this situation. my family and i plan to stay here for a while, so i plan to take chinese lessons and improve my communication skills. unfortunately, i don&amp;rsquo;t have that much time right now because i&amp;rsquo;m doing an mba in leadership &amp;amp; management on the side. however, my hr department has offered me to take chinese lessons every day. i am planning to take them up on their offer soon. how is your family adapting?  my family is currently on vacation in germany visiting our family. depending on the local situation with covid, they should return in august/september when school starts again. i hope they lift the mandatory hotel quarantine soon&amp;hellip;laughs. i think, in general, everyone is adjusting pretty well.my wife is currently a stay-at-home parent, as my youngest son still needs a lot of attention. she had a job when we lived in germany. but with the current situation, we have decided that it is better for her to stay at home for now.we live in zhubei, and due to our multicultural background, we were able to connect with the german and the turkish community here. that&amp;rsquo;s great for us because it makes a lot of things easier. i have to spend a lot of time at work, so my wife needs to have the opportunity to make friends. we did some research before the move and found that there were enough people to connect with. so that was also an important factor before the move.my oldest son goes to the local american school. he really likes the school and has some friends there. my youngest already went to kindergarten and will also go to kindergarten full time when he returns from germany. this will be great for my wife, so she will have much more time for other things. she plans to take chinese classes and eventually get a job as well. right now, she has made cooking her hobby and has also started an instagram blog. otherwise, she spends a lot of time meeting up with her girlfriends, for example.on the weekends, we get together with other families and go on trips to go sightseeing, the beach, the mountains, etc. it is certainly easy to find something to do here.   close            what surprised you the most about taiwan?  i don&amp;rsquo;t think anything really surprised me too much. i&amp;rsquo;ve already had the opportunity to come here before, and i don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;ve had any type of cultural shock. we&amp;rsquo;ve already had the chance to get to know different cultures due to our turkish background, so it was easy to adapt.one thing, though, is the traffic laughs. i have a car here and drive myself. it really surprised me how wild the scooters are, and it still does every day laughs. this is another challenge i am facing every day laughs. you really do have to be careful.also, every time i go into nature, i realize how beautiful it is. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how often i go; it&amp;rsquo;s still wonderful over and over again. what&amp;rsquo;s the biggest difference between germany and taiwan for you?  i think for us personally, the big difference is that we don&amp;rsquo;t have a family here. when you have a toddler, it&amp;rsquo;s especially noticeable. we used to be able to just leave the kids with family, and of course, we can&amp;rsquo;t do that here.there are many differences, but i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that anything has really affected us too much. it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get around, and you can buy everything you need here, including western food. of course, it will be more expensive, but you get used to it after a while and find all the places to buy certain things. if we really miss something that we can&amp;rsquo;t find here, we ask our family to send it over. it&amp;rsquo;s not really expensive and easily doable.sure the weather is hotter and more humid, the traffic is a little crazy, and you change your summer outdoor activities a little bit because of the heat. but it&amp;rsquo;s nothing crazy. after a while, you don&amp;rsquo;t even notice it that much. would you recommend friends coming to live and work in taiwan?  i would definitely recommend taiwan to friends. however, i would suggest that you visit first and get to know your potential employer. then, make sure you make an informed decision and that you may encounter some differences and challenges. in general, though, it&amp;rsquo;s a great place to live. if you have a stay-at-home partner, just make sure there are enough people nearby to connect with and have something to keep them busy. what are your favorite spots so far in taiwan?  we have been to many places: kenting, kaohsiung, taitung, taipei, keelung, etc. we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at so many mountains and beaches, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard for us to decide which is our favorite place. i think the whole island is just our favorite place laughs. we love going to a different place every weekend, especially the beaches. we also love to go hiking, though with our toddler, that&amp;rsquo;s a little limited right now.   close            how long are you looking to stay here?  my family and i plan to stay at least 3-5 years. it depends on the future of my company. one of the reasons i am here is that the company plans to grow in europe (including germany) in the next 3-5 years. and that would be the time when i would go back and continue to work for the company in europe. that would be the plan for now. any last thoughts?  in retrospect, it was the right decision to come to taiwan. it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun to work for my company. of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a challenge, but i knew it would be. one of the reasons we also decided to take on this challenge was that we wanted to get out of our comfort zone in germany. we felt like we weren&amp;rsquo;t getting anywhere with our jobs and our personal lives. so we wanted to get out and experience something new and exciting. and we made the right decision.i think it&amp;rsquo;s a very personal decision and everyone has their own experiences. you should be prepared that moving to taiwan brings its own challenges, but i think that&amp;rsquo;s completely normal."},{"index":"1","summary":"from new york to indonesia to formosa - life as a digital nomad in taiwan    from new york to indonesia to formosa - life as a digital nomad in taiwan  the taiwan employment gold card office had the honor of sitting down with gold card holder yvette jong for an interview.jong grew up in new york as a third-culture kid, influenced by taiwanese, indonesian, and chinese heritage. she currently works as a hospitality strategist; her clientele includes international hotels, destinations, and restaurants. many are private member clubs, and jong helps them build strategies around their business needs. in 2020, jong traveled to taiwan with her husband and daughter, and we are excited to hear about her experiences on our beautiful island. check out yvette jong | craft house consulting   tell us about your job and what you enjoy most?  in hospitality, i can live vicariously through my work. it&amp;rsquo;s constantly about the customer&amp;rsquo;s journey, so it almost feels like virtual travel. of course, i also focus on the business aspects to ensure financial and operational viability, but at the end of the day, we have to make sure there&amp;rsquo;s a reason customers come (and come again). in some ways, it can be torturous because i am constantly looking at pictures of the blue waters in the caribbean, the lush jungles in asia, or historical destinations in europe. but, of course, i do get to travel a lot.   close            do you always travel and live a nomadic lifestyle, or are you usually based in one location?  pre-covid? laughs after growing up in new york, i never thought i would live in a big city again. i thought i would live on a farm somewhere like montana because i wanted to escape the urban life. but then i studied hospitality and realized i could live and work anywhere in the world.by the time i was 23, i had lived and worked in taiwan, thailand, shanghai, and scotland. i lived in many places but eventually went back to new york, which still didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right. so i headed back to asia again and almost worked in beijing for the olympics, but landed in hong kong, where i consulted with a group that brought me all across asia. there was a moment when i was living between hong kong and bali.when i founded my consulting firm in 2011, i decided craft house would be free of a physical location, allowing my strategists and me to work from any place they please so long as we were near an airport and had strong wifi. since our clients are everywhere in the world - from manila to mauritius, costa rica to california - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where we sleep at night. at present, my strategists are based everywhere from monaco to minneapolis, siem reap to seattle. and since my husband vinc&amp;rsquo;s work requires us to travel around the world, my business arrangement works particularly well for us. your husband works with bamboo, right? can you elaborate on what he does?     close           vinc is a german carpenter, which is something he trained for intensely in his bavarian village germany. when he was 17, someone gave him the opportunity to move to africa for work, and he took it. he worked with gtz then met jörg stamm, a fellow german carpenter but also one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most influential bamboo visionaries, and vinc was like, &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s this?&amp;rdquo; it isn&amp;rsquo;t the bamboo that we picture in chinese paintings. it&amp;rsquo;s this huge, fat bamboo the size of trees that take 3 years to grow and is then used to build with architecturally. vinc&amp;rsquo;s consulting work helps train local teams to transform the conceptual drawings made by architects into physical 3 to 6-story pavilions, homes, and megastructures - so they don&amp;rsquo;t fall down laughs.   close            about vinc math   you decided to come to taiwan last year, tell us more about that.  we originally planned to visit taiwan in february 2020 to celebrate my dad&amp;rsquo;s 80th birthday and just to be in taiwan to eat, cause, laughs that&amp;rsquo;s what you do! but, when covid hit, we canceled the trip and quarantined early. in november, we decided we were ready to head back to asia for 2-3 months since taiwan was doing well. we were like, &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s go!&amp;rdquo; since we both work remotely and our daughter wasn&amp;rsquo;t in school, we took this opportunity to see 阿嬤 (ā mā, grandma), 阿公 (ā gōng, grandpa), have her learn chinese, and explore the country as a family. it would also allow us to touch base with asia-based clients. in truth, vinc and i had spoken previously about living in taiwan, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the opportunity. when we heard about the gold card, we realized this was our chance. how did you hear about the gold card and decide that this is something you could qualify for?  my cousins have been in taiwan for 10 years and we&amp;rsquo;ve lived in both new york and hong kong at the same time in the past. since they know i&amp;rsquo;m the type to &amp;ldquo;go on vacation&amp;rdquo; but not return for 10 years, they said, &amp;ldquo;you might wanna consider it ;).&amp;rdquo; and i was like, &amp;ldquo;okay!&amp;rdquo; you have lived and worked in places all over the world; what makes taiwan different and special for you?  for me, there&amp;rsquo;s a strong sense of belonging. we have family reunions in taiwan every 4 years or so, which have reinforced my connection to taiwan. that, and i also did &amp;ldquo;love boat&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;love boat&amp;rdquo; is a summer camp to learn chinese in taiwan) when i was 16! it was my first experience of independence, going to this country to learn chinese and having the time of my life. it was a rite of passage into adulthood, and we got up to all sorts of mischief. some of my friends now are still friends from back then. about love boat  the opportunity for my husband and daughter to fall in love with taiwan for themselves was important for me. and hearing our daughter speak and sing her first mandarin words was almost monumental because i grew up as a third culture kid in new york who never wanted to speak chinese (until i was much older).then there&amp;rsquo;s the variety. food is always a celebration – whether we have our daily streetside fantuan or venture out of the way to have the perfect stinky tofu stall (which vinc loves more than i do). and lastly, the mix of urban living with nature helped us balance life a little easier. we toured the island, swam on the beaches, cycled in sun moon lake, hiked alishan to see the sunrise, soaking in the hot springs, and even joined a weekly hiking class in taipei for 4-6-year-olds where we saw some of the most amazing scenery from the surrounding mountains. what does your husband think about taiwan?  he thinks it&amp;rsquo;s amazing. it took him some time to find his own tribe of people working in sustainable architecture, but luckily he found them. each introduction led him to another and the more he connected with them to learn about passion and share industry secrets (often with a translator), he realized that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a foreigner in another country.   close           he also found it safe and easy to get around with the help of instant translation apps. now, he could take our daughter around town on his own to their favorite hangouts like the skate park in nangang ;) we were blown away by how many kids in taiwan are on inline skates. they fit right in! what is your favorite thing to do in taiwan?  it really depends on how long i am spending in taiwan. if it&amp;rsquo;s a short trip, it&amp;rsquo;s all about the local breakfasts, night markets, and my favorite, those little stationery stores. i always buy stationery items that i don&amp;rsquo;t need and will never use because they&amp;rsquo;re just so precious. for example, look at these mahjong post-its notes shows post-it notes or these german-themed ones with wurst and pretzels. and this edamame keychain that has smiling edamame you squeeze out laughs.   close           this time we had the opportunity to stay such a long time, and it gave us the freedom to just do more than we had hoped for. in the beginning, i wanted to do something every day, explore the whole island, but then we could slow down and picnic or laze by the beach with friends.   close            do you think there are work opportunities for you in taiwan?  yes, i was hoping to do some work in taiwan since i can adapt to local market needs and provide strategies to small non-profits and large international hotel chains alike. even with covid, there is work for hotels and hospitality businesses to assess their business models. for me, there&amp;rsquo;s always work to find! in the absence of taiwan-based clients, i loved the opportunity to speak to junior high and high school students at both local and international schools about life, careers, risks, travel, and much more. vinc and i both spoke at the taipei european school, and i had a separate presentation at a local junior high school in taoyuan. it&amp;rsquo;s experiences like this that are sometimes more rewarding than work.   close            what is something that you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect from taiwan before living here for an extended period of time?  we knew we&amp;rsquo;d find peers working in global innovation professionally – in fact, we would have been surprised if we didn&amp;rsquo;t meet changemakers along the way. but to list the things that did surprise us along the way would take hours to talk about.   close           as a family, we didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to find micro-communities that shared our personal family interests. by chance, we found a children&amp;rsquo;s hiking class thanks to someone who was selling his used car seat. our families became fast friends, and the hiking class became instrumental in our experience in taiwan. the instructor is an amazing individual who wants nothing more than to teach our tiny 4-6 years old how to be responsible human beings. then we found a small play-based &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo; beside our local park that focuses on personal growth and community. both groups aligned with our style of parenting, and we loved it.   close           we also didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to attend my father&amp;rsquo;s solo exhibit at sun yat-sen memorial hall, which featured 66 paintings he painted since covid started!   close              close            what are your future plans?  we would love to go back to taiwan. my gold card is valid for another 3 years or so, and we are definitely open to going back and working there. and now that my daughter can speak chinese, we definitely want to return so she can keep it up. the last thing we tried to do before leaving was getting my husband his own gold card. do you have anything else you would like to add or say? husband vinc appears in the call  vinc: &amp;ldquo;my time in taiwan was very special. i mean, from a parent&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&amp;rdquo;yvette: &amp;ldquo;he loved spending time with my parents!&amp;rdquo;vince: &amp;ldquo;uh, both laugh what i am saying is from a parent&amp;rsquo;s perspective, it was amazing. all these playgrounds everywhere, how open people are, and those little groups we&amp;rsquo;ve bumped into, like the hiking class. i don&amp;rsquo;t really know what it would be like without having kids, so i can&amp;rsquo;t judge. but taipei is a super place, the country is beautiful, and the food is great.yvette: &amp;ldquo;what we also wanted to do was move down to maybe taitung for a little bit. or spend more time in hualien. we had this vision of going down to taitung for 6 months, so hopefully, in the future, this will work out.&amp;rdquo;   close           "},{"index":"2","summary":"from one month runway to 300% growth - the us/taiwan startup story of han jin &amp; lucid   from one month runway to 300% growth - the us/taiwan startup story of han jin &amp;amp; lucid  han jin, emigrated to germany from china at age 6. he grew up in hamburg, and received his bsc in management science &amp;amp; general engineering from the karlsruhe institute of technology. he then finished his masters in engineering from the university of california in berkeley in 2012.after working as a program manager at sandisk for three years, han began his dream of being an entrepreneur, founding lucid in 2015, an computer vision company in california. he was recognized for his accomplishments in forbes 30 under 30 and inc 30 under 30 for consumer technology in 2018.han first came to taiwan as part of the garage&#43; program, joining their first batch of oversea entrepreneurs, and fell in love with taiwan. he now spends his time managing lucid’s cross-border teams in taipei, taiwan and san jose, usa. here is his story. how did you hear about taiwan?  back in silicon valley, i had heard about some taiwan startup programs through outreach project managers (which were sponsored by the ministry of science &amp;amp; technology). so in 2015, i joined the first batch from garage&#43;, and then also joined the sparklabs taipei program at taiwan tech arena in 2018. through these programs i was able to find hardware manufacturing partners such as wistron who produced lucid’s first 3d camera, and develop products which were in partnership with red in their hydrogen one smartphone.at the time, i was still spending most of my time with the team in san jose, but being brought up in a chinese family, the language and food in taiwan was familiar. i did have some culture shock coming from the us though. there were just so many rules, where in the us we were taught to question rules and find arbitrage, in taiwan, people follow the rules to the t, and sometimes that stands in the way of finding innovation outside the box.but over time i figured out how to work within the system. i enjoyed the lifestyle here, transportation was so convenient, the people were friendly, and with the company’s needs for a strong hardware partner, i decided to set up a subsidiary of the us lucid here. the low cost of living in addition to the excellent standard of living is key to the success of startup teams without much funding.   close            when did you hear about the gold card?  i heard about the gold card through a friend, and received my card in july 2018. i’m now on my second card (renewed in april 2020) and it’s been a lifesaver! it has allowed me to settle here completely, work, and most importantly, i’m treated basically like a citizen. during covid last year, i even received facemasks from the government.i’ve since met my taiwanese fiancé here, bought a house in xindian, and besides business trips to manage the team in the us, i will be based here. how has it been running a startup? especially during covid?  it’s extremely difficult! lucid almost died three times over the past years, the worst was when we only had one month of cash left. but somehow, and always during christmas, i’ve been able to either find an investor, land a large corporate contract, or somehow manage to find customer growth. that’s the nature of startups, one winter i’m having to let people go, and then all of a sudden, we are experiencing 300% month on month growth! we call it the “christmas wonders.”during covid, we have had to pivot into more software-based services focusing on video content. taiwan has been crucial for this, as it was safe enough for me to meet with my team in the office and hire more talents here, when the us was on lockdown.   close            how has it been setting up and managing teams in two countries? how are the two teams different?  i started the taiwan team with just 2 people, growing it to 10 and now have about 20 people in total. we are now also hiring!two-thirds of the company is actually in taiwan now, and more than 80% of the company are engineers. there’s a balance of people in both teams, and i believe in combining the strengths of the taiwan team with the us team for achieving the best results.in general, the culture in taiwan focuses on linear execution, delivering products, developing features within tight schedules. they are exceptional in building technology and deep in their own crafts, but often people don’t strive to standout. the team spirit is also very strong, probably due to the cultural emphasis on family. in the us, the team has other priorities and often they want to be different and creative with their solutions. therefore, they focus more on research and strategy.   close            how has it been hiring in taiwan compared to the us?  the interview process is really different. in the us, silicon valley encourages big thinking, but also deep dive very quickly on a specific use case. interviews usually include creative questions that challenges your abilities to solve a unknown problem on the spot. in taiwan, the interviews are more generic, there is a lot of focus on standardized testing and technical abilities.language can also still be a barrier though, if candidates are not comfortable in english, they cannot present themselves, making it difficult to be attractive for us recruiters.finding talent in taiwan is very different than in the us, as people follow a sort of herd mentality here. you have to tap into certain engineering circles for hiring. i brought over the previous gm of a mobile tech company, and relied heavily on him to bring over his previous peers. thank you for sharing your experiences, han. any last thoughts?  in a startup, i had to try so many things that failed, and to this day i still fail every day. however, i never regret quitting my well-paid stable corporate job to jump into this adventure. at the end of the day, you will realize that a big salary does not define happiness, but what you do with your limited amount of time in life. even though to most people, quitting my well-paid corporate job was the most stupid decision and yet, i feel it was the best decision, because sometimes you have to just take a risk on yourself as life is too short.we are currently looking to expand and need to hire a lot of engineers. there are some exciting news coming for lucid soon that i can’t announce yet. so, if there are any engineers and developers looking to join our adventure, please contact me!if you are interested in working for lucid, please contact: hr@lucidinside.com   cakeresume details  "}]
