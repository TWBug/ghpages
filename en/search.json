Minister Kung, Ming-Hsin appreciated the support from legislators of each political party to make the draft Amendments pass the examination in the Legislative Yuan. The Amendments aim to build a more complete legal framework for recruiting talents, so more international talents can &amp;ldquo;get in&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;stay&amp;rdquo;. NDC’s mission is to make Taiwan a talent hub of the Asia-Pacific region &amp;mdash; a veritable &amp;ldquo;Asian Silicon Valley&amp;rdquo;.To ensure that foreign professionals meet certain qualifications, the Amendments relax regulations on work, residence, dependency, while optimizing social protection without reducing the salary threshold. The main points of the amendments are as follows: Expanding the scope of foreign professionals: Adding the field of national defense to the expertise of “foreign special professional”; building the consultation mechanism of the competent authority on examining the expertise of “foreign special professional”; allowing the &amp;ldquo;Special Classes for Children of Foreign Talents&amp;rdquo; approved by the Ministry of Education to hire foreign subject teachers; adding teachers of experimental education to the scope to foreign professionals; exempting graduates of the world’s top universities announced by the Ministry of Education from being required to have at least two years’ work experience as a prerequisite for taking up specialized or technical work. Easing of provisions concerning independent and dependent residency: Allowing foreign professionals and foreign special professionals who enter the country with a visa exemption or visitor visa, and their dependent relatives, to apply for an Alien Residence Certificate without needing to apply for a resident visa; easing the conditions for foreign professionals to obtain permanent residency by shortening the requisite duration of residence from five years to three years for foreign special professionals, and allowing 1 to 2 years spent at school in Taiwan obtaining advanced degrees of master’s level and above to be counted toward fulfilling the requisite duration of continuous residence. Optimizing social protection and tax concession: Extending from three years to five years the period in which foreign special professionals can utilize the tax concession bestowed on them by this Act; relaxing the law to provide for foreign special professionals and foreign senior professionals who meet the criteria for being insured as employers or self-employed business owners, together with their dependent relatives, to join the NHI system without having to wait for six months.  NDC will cooperate with related ministries to complete relevant regulations and measures as soon as possible, and report to the Executive Yuan for designating the implementation date, so the laws can apply to foreign professionals and their relatives.In addition to amending the Act, NDC will continue to promote the global recruitment action targeting talents of the 5&#43;2 and Six Core Strategic Industries, and establish policy coordination mechanisms to address issues related to Employment Gold Card applications, settling in Taiwan, job matching, starting a business, etc. The vision is to enrich the national talent pool and accelerate industrial transformation and upgrading by building a comprehensive legal framework and implement measures to attract more global talents and outstanding youths to come to Taiwan.","tags":[],"categories":["Gold Card Policy"],"href":"/en/news/amendments-to-the-act-for-the-recruitment-and-employment-of-foreign-professionals-approved-by-the-legislative-yuan/"},{"title":" I currently live in Taiwan/have an ARC/am on a Tourist Visa in Taiwan, can I still apply for the Gold Card?","content":"Yes, you can apply from anywhere, even within Taiwan.

Now it has been approved by the Executive Yuan and will formally take effect today (October 25). The amended provisions of the Act lay a more complete legal framework for our country’s talent recruitment, ensuring that more of the world’s prime talent will be able to come to and stay in Taiwan.In order to expand the attraction of international high-level talent to the five-plus-two innovative industries and the Six Core Strategic Industries, last year (2020) the NDC began to consult with the other authorities concerned on a nuts-and-bolts overhaul of the Foreign Professionals Act aimed at providing more attractive regulation of work and residency, and optimizing benefits related to tax and social security. The main points of the amendment are as follows: Increasing flexibility for the recognition of foreign special professionals: Provision is added for a mechanism to enable recognition by the Competent Authority (the NDC) in consultation with the central competent authorities concerned, so that the world’s new forms of industry and cross-field talent can be brought within the sweep of recruitment. Vying for graduates of the world’s top universities to come to work in Taiwan: Eligibility for graduates of the world’s top universities, as announced by the Ministry of Education[1], to engage in specialized or technical work in Taiwan, is relaxed by removal of the two years’ work experience requirement. Loosening regulations for foreign nationals’ permanent residency applications: The period of continuous residence in Taiwan required for foreign special professionals to apply for permanent residency is reduced from five years to three, further discounted by one year for those who have obtained a doctoral degree in Taiwan. Also, while (ordinary) foreign professionals are still required to have resided continuously in Taiwan for five years before they can apply for permanent residency, that period can be discounted by one or two years, respectively, for those who have obtained a master’s or doctoral degree in Taiwan. Enhancing tax preference and social security measures: The time limit on the tax preference for foreign special professionals is extended from three years to five; and foreign special and senior professionals who are employers or self-employed business owners, together with their dependent relatives, are exempted from having to wait six months to join the National Health Insurance system.To go in concert with the implementation of this amended law, the NDC has worked with the authorities concerned to amend related regulations, administrative rules and supporting measures, so that foreign professionals and their dependent relatives can utilize these long-awaited changes to the law as early as possible, and to ensure that the Foreign Professionals Act can secure optimum spillover effects, enhancing the retention of key global talent, invigorating Taiwan’s talent pool, and bringing qualitative change, growth, and transformation into Taiwan’s industries.  With the amendment to of the Foreign Professionals Act going into effect from today, applications under all of the amended provisions can start to be received, including those pertaining to the expedition of foreign special professionals’ permanent residency applications, which has drawn the greatest interest in many circles. Inquiries are welcome at the National Immigration Agency’s local service centers or the Taiwan Employment Gold Card Office.

Close           Taiwan’s speedy response and organized reaction to the pandemic is due to a painful past experience. During the 2003 SARS pandemic, Taiwan’s economy, social order, and medical systems were all severely impacted, and the country suffered greatly. After the SARS pandemic subsided, the Taiwanese vowed to learn and grow from this painful memory, and created an epidemic prevention strategy that was implemented across all medical systems.   Close           When the Taiwanese government first heard about the mystery virus from Wuhan, China in December 2019, they immediately began quarantining direct flights from Wuhan. By the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 was classified as a Category 5 Notifiable Communicable Disease, and Taiwan began implementing strict pandemic policies such as restricting travel to and from other countries, launching a domestic mask rationing system, and a mandatory 14-day quarantine period for all travelers who enter Taiwan. Due to these strict prevention policies, 87% of all COVID-19 cases in Taiwan have been imported from abroad.COVID-19 has caused a global economic collapse, affecting many countries including Taiwan. In response to this, the Taiwanese government has introduced many relief measures and stimulus packages to aid and revitalize industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic, such as the tourism and hotel industries. For the general public, the government has provided different types of vouchers such as triple stimulus vouchers, art vouchers, and travel vouchers to increase domestic consumption and to boost the economy.   Close           Starting December 1st, the Taiwanese government implemented the Autumn and Winter Epidemic Prevention Project in order to strengthen border quarantine measures, community epidemic prevention, and medical response.Border quarantine measures: All inbound and transit passengers (regardless of nationality or purpose of arrival) must submit a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test report within three days of their flight to Taiwan. Community epidemic prevention: Masks must be worn when entering and leaving eight categories of places, including medical care facilities, mass transit, personal consumption locations, educational institutions, exhibitions and sporting events, entertainment and leisure venues, houses of worship, and public service and customer service centers. Those who fail to comply will face a fine of between NT$3,000 and NT$15,000. Medical Response: The CECC is aiming to strengthen notifications and testing and establish rewards for hospitals that test patients.   Close           As the imminent second wave of COVID-19 hits, many governments have implemented strict policies to limit the social lives of their citizens. As Taiwan has been diligent in its epidemic prevention, its citizens are able to enjoy a relatively normal life aside from restricting travel outside of the country. With hopes to control and ultimately halt the pandemic, many countries are currently trying to develop and produce the COVID-19 vaccine. Though small in size, Taiwan has proven to be capable in battling the pandemic, and is currently one of the safest places to be.

We have two children, one is 16, and the other is 3 years old. My family and I moved to Taiwan from Lippstadt, Germany, in April 2020; my family arrived 2 months later. Since then, we have been living in Zhubei, Hsinchu County.I work for Excellence Opto, Inc. (EOI), an international Taiwanese company in the automotive industry. EOI manufactures and develops LEDs and printed circuit boards. EOI&amp;rsquo;s customers include Tesla, Ford, Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, GM, Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan, Skoda, BAIC Group, etc. The headquarters is in Taiwan. I am currently Director of Global Quality &amp;amp; Member of the Management Board.   Close            Was Taiwan your first experience living abroad and getting introduced to Asian culture?  I grew up with Japanese culture because I have a black belt in karate. I started this martial art when I was 8 years old. Later at university, I worked in a Chinese restaurant. All my coworkers were Chinese, and I also picked up a little Chinese. That was a lot of fun.10 years ago, I had the opportunity to go to Beijing for 2 years with my employer at the time, HELLA. That was my first experience going abroad, and it was a big culture shock. At that time, I was doing similar work to what I am doing now. Before I moved here, I traveled around Asia a lot and had seen Taiwan before COVID. How does your experience in Beijing differ from Taiwan?  At that time, I was a classic expat with a contract of 2 years. I also did not bring my family with me. Every 6 weeks, I would fly to Germany to spend time with them. This time my employment is a bit different. I was hired locally, and I am in for the long haul. What brought you to Taiwan?  I came because EOI offered me the opportunity to work for them as Director of Global Quality. The whole package was great. Salary, opportunities&amp;hellip; But most importantly, with the role I&amp;rsquo;ve been given, I have the decision-making power to make a difference. I can use all my knowledge and experience to influence the company&amp;rsquo;s future and hopefully create a better future. That is one of the main reasons why I was hired and why I accepted the offer.At my previous company in Germany, I was already able to accomplish a lot. But here, I can really see the impact my work has.Before I accepted this position, I brought my family to visit and check out my potential future company. We also used the time to go sightseeing, look at housing and international schools, and understand the living conditions and lifestyle. We wanted to make sure we made an informed decision before we moved.We decided pretty quickly that this was the right choice because the living conditions were not very different from what we were used to in Germany.   Close            Why the Taiwan Employment Gold Card?  The HR team at my company did a great job researching all the visa options for me in advance. They presented the Gold Card as the best possible option for me, and I agreed. The fact that it is an all-in-one visa and that it offered me tax benefits was amazing. Afterward, my HR team helped me with the whole application process; I just had to give them all the necessary paperwork. How&amp;rsquo;s the work environment compared to Germany?  Well, I used to have a 35-hour workweek (laughs). I definitely work a lot more here, which puts a lot more housework on my wife. People here work much harder and much longer.Of course, I can&amp;rsquo;t speak for all businesses, but based on my conversations with friends in Taiwan who work in all sizes of businesses, it appears that digitization is not as advanced as it is in Germany. As a result, people often have to work harder to compensate. I believe Taiwan still has a long way to go in terms of digitalization in the workplace. But that also offers a lot of opportunities for new possibilities.Specifically for my work, the processes in Germany take much longer. That&amp;rsquo;s because many work processes are more detailed and in-depth. Here, people try to get the work done as quickly as possible, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t always allow for that depth.One of the things that struck me was the respect for work hierarchies. It is important for companies here, whereas people usually don&amp;rsquo;t care that much about it in Germany. My position allows me a lot of decision-making power, but I often have to discuss a lot with my superiors to come to a conclusion. What are your biggest challenges?  Something I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really prepared for was also the different mentalities I have to deal with, mainly because of my position. My job is to bring improvements to the company and find solutions to problems. Since I&amp;rsquo;m based at headquarters, I have to deal with employees in China and the U.S., which can be quite a challenge at times.However, one of my biggest challenges is the language barrier. I have some basic knowledge of Mandarin, but it&amp;rsquo;s not really enough. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily very easy; most of our meetings are in Chinese, and I have to make sure I find a way to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on. There are many technical tools that help with this, sometimes I ask my colleagues to help me translate, or someone on my team helps me take meeting minutes. Luckily, some of my team members can speak English well.Our CEO is amazing. She spent a long time in the States, so she speaks perfect English, definitely better than me laughs. She helps and supports me a lot. She translates and makes sure I stay up to date.But the language barrier is a big challenge, I must say. I would like to change this situation. My family and I plan to stay here for a while, so I plan to take Chinese lessons and improve my communication skills. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have that much time right now because I&amp;rsquo;m doing an MBA in Leadership &amp;amp; Management on the side. However, my HR department has offered me to take Chinese lessons every day. I am planning to take them up on their offer soon. How is your family adapting?  My family is currently on vacation in Germany visiting our family. Depending on the local situation with Covid, they should return in August/September when school starts again. I hope they lift the mandatory hotel quarantine soon&amp;hellip;laughs. I think, in general, everyone is adjusting pretty well.My wife is currently a stay-at-home parent, as my youngest son still needs a lot of attention. She had a job when we lived in Germany. But with the current situation, we have decided that it is better for her to stay at home for now.We live in Zhubei, and due to our multicultural background, we were able to connect with the German and the Turkish community here. That&amp;rsquo;s great for us because it makes a lot of things easier. I have to spend a lot of time at work, so my wife needs to have the opportunity to make friends. We did some research before the move and found that there were enough people to connect with. So that was also an important factor before the move.My oldest son goes to the local American school. He really likes the school and has some friends there. My youngest already went to kindergarten and will also go to kindergarten full time when he returns from Germany. This will be great for my wife, so she will have much more time for other things. She plans to take Chinese classes and eventually get a job as well. Right now, she has made cooking her hobby and has also started an Instagram blog. Otherwise, she spends a lot of time meeting up with her girlfriends, for example.On the weekends, we get together with other families and go on trips to go sightseeing, the beach, the mountains, etc. It is certainly easy to find something to do here.   Close            What surprised you the most about Taiwan?  I don&amp;rsquo;t think anything really surprised me too much. I&amp;rsquo;ve already had the opportunity to come here before, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;ve had any type of cultural shock. We&amp;rsquo;ve already had the chance to get to know different cultures due to our Turkish background, so it was easy to adapt.One thing, though, is the traffic laughs. I have a car here and drive myself. It really surprised me how wild the scooters are, and it still does every day laughs. This is another challenge I am facing every day laughs. You really do have to be careful.Also, every time I go into nature, I realize how beautiful it is. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how often I go; it&amp;rsquo;s still wonderful over and over again. What&amp;rsquo;s the biggest difference between Germany and Taiwan for you?  I think for us personally, the big difference is that we don&amp;rsquo;t have a family here. When you have a toddler, it&amp;rsquo;s especially noticeable. We used to be able to just leave the kids with family, and of course, we can&amp;rsquo;t do that here.There are many differences, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that anything has really affected us too much. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get around, and you can buy everything you need here, including western food. Of course, it will be more expensive, but you get used to it after a while and find all the places to buy certain things. If we really miss something that we can&amp;rsquo;t find here, we ask our family to send it over. It&amp;rsquo;s not really expensive and easily doable.Sure the weather is hotter and more humid, the traffic is a little crazy, and you change your summer outdoor activities a little bit because of the heat. But it&amp;rsquo;s nothing crazy. After a while, you don&amp;rsquo;t even notice it that much. Would you recommend friends coming to live and work in Taiwan?  I would definitely recommend Taiwan to friends. However, I would suggest that you visit first and get to know your potential employer. Then, make sure you make an informed decision and that you may encounter some differences and challenges. In general, though, it&amp;rsquo;s a great place to live. If you have a stay-at-home partner, just make sure there are enough people nearby to connect with and have something to keep them busy. What are your favorite spots so far in Taiwan?  We have been to many places: Kenting, Kaohsiung, Taitung, Taipei, Keelung, etc. We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at so many mountains and beaches, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard for us to decide which is our favorite place. I think the whole island is just our favorite place laughs. We love going to a different place every weekend, especially the beaches. We also love to go hiking, though with our toddler, that&amp;rsquo;s a little limited right now.   Close            How long are you looking to stay here?  My family and I plan to stay at least 3-5 years. It depends on the future of my company. One of the reasons I am here is that the company plans to grow in Europe (including Germany) in the next 3-5 years. And that would be the time when I would go back and continue to work for the company in Europe. That would be the plan for now. Any last thoughts?  In retrospect, it was the right decision to come to Taiwan. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun to work for my company. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a challenge, but I knew it would be. One of the reasons we also decided to take on this challenge was that we wanted to get out of our comfort zone in Germany. We felt like we weren&amp;rsquo;t getting anywhere with our jobs and our personal lives. So we wanted to get out and experience something new and exciting. And we made the right decision.I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very personal decision and everyone has their own experiences. You should be prepared that moving to Taiwan brings its own challenges, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s completely normal.","tags":[],"categories":[],"href":"/en/why-taiwan/from-corporate-germany-to-corporate-taiwan-a-different-perspective/"},{"title":"From New York to Indonesia to Formosa - Life as a Digital Nomad in Taiwan ","content":"  From New York to Indonesia to Formosa - Life as a Digital Nomad in Taiwan  The Taiwan Employment Gold Card Office had the honor of sitting down with Gold Card Holder Yvette Jong for an interview.Jong grew up in New York as a third-culture kid, influenced by Taiwanese, Indonesian, and Chinese heritage. She currently works as a Hospitality Strategist; her clientele includes international hotels, destinations, and restaurants. Many are private member clubs, and Jong helps them build strategies around their business needs. In 2020, Jong traveled to Taiwan with her husband and daughter, and we are excited to hear about her experiences on our beautiful island. Check out Yvette Jong | Craft House Consulting   Tell us about your job and what you enjoy most?  In hospitality, I can live vicariously through my work. It&amp;rsquo;s constantly about the customer&amp;rsquo;s journey, so it almost feels like virtual travel. Of course, I also focus on the business aspects to ensure financial and operational viability, but at the end of the day, we have to make sure there&amp;rsquo;s a reason customers come (and come again). In some ways, it can be torturous because I am constantly looking at pictures of the blue waters in the Caribbean, the lush jungles in Asia, or historical destinations in Europe. But, of course, I do get to travel a lot.   Close            Do you always travel and live a nomadic lifestyle, or are you usually based in one location?  Pre-COVID? laughs After growing up in New York, I never thought I would live in a big city again. I thought I would live on a farm somewhere like Montana because I wanted to escape the urban life. But then I studied hospitality and realized I could live and work anywhere in the world.By the time I was 23, I had lived and worked in Taiwan, Thailand, Shanghai, and Scotland. I lived in many places but eventually went back to New York, which still didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right. So I headed back to Asia again and almost worked in Beijing for the Olympics, but landed in Hong Kong, where I consulted with a group that brought me all across Asia. There was a moment when I was living between Hong Kong and Bali.When I founded my consulting firm in 2011, I decided Craft House would be free of a physical location, allowing my strategists and me to work from any place they please so long as we were near an airport and had strong wifi. Since our clients are everywhere in the world - from Manila to Mauritius, Costa Rica to California - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where we sleep at night. At present, my strategists are based everywhere from Monaco to Minneapolis, Siem Reap to Seattle. And since my husband Vinc&amp;rsquo;s work requires us to travel around the world, my business arrangement works particularly well for us. Your husband works with bamboo, right? Can you elaborate on what he does?     Close           Vinc is a German carpenter, which is something he trained for intensely in his Bavarian village Germany. When he was 17, someone gave him the opportunity to move to Africa for work, and he took it. He worked with GTZ then met Jörg Stamm, a fellow German carpenter but also one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most influential bamboo visionaries, and Vinc was like, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this?&amp;rdquo; It isn&amp;rsquo;t the bamboo that we picture in Chinese paintings. It&amp;rsquo;s this huge, fat bamboo the size of trees that take 3 years to grow and is then used to build with architecturally. Vinc&amp;rsquo;s consulting work helps train local teams to transform the conceptual drawings made by architects into physical 3 to 6-story pavilions, homes, and megastructures - so they don&amp;rsquo;t fall down laughs.   Close            About Vinc Math   You decided to come to Taiwan last year, tell us more about that.  We originally planned to visit Taiwan in February 2020 to celebrate my dad&amp;rsquo;s 80th birthday and just to be in Taiwan to eat, cause, laughs that&amp;rsquo;s what you do! But, when COVID hit, we canceled the trip and quarantined early. In November, we decided we were ready to head back to Asia for 2-3 months since Taiwan was doing well. We were like, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s go!&amp;rdquo; Since we both work remotely and our daughter wasn&amp;rsquo;t in school, we took this opportunity to see 阿嬤 (ā mā, Grandma), 阿公 (ā gōng, Grandpa), have her learn Chinese, and explore the country as a family. It would also allow us to touch base with Asia-based clients. In truth, Vinc and I had spoken previously about living in Taiwan, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the opportunity. When we heard about the Gold Card, we realized this was our chance. How did you hear about the Gold Card and decide that this is something you could qualify for?  My cousins have been in Taiwan for 10 years and we&amp;rsquo;ve lived in both New York and Hong Kong at the same time in the past. Since they know I&amp;rsquo;m the type to &amp;ldquo;go on vacation&amp;rdquo; but not return for 10 years, they said, &amp;ldquo;You might wanna consider it ;).&amp;rdquo; And I was like, &amp;ldquo;Okay!&amp;rdquo; You have lived and worked in places all over the world; what makes Taiwan different and special for you?  For me, there&amp;rsquo;s a strong sense of belonging. We have family reunions in Taiwan every 4 years or so, which have reinforced my connection to Taiwan. That, and I also did &amp;ldquo;Love Boat&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Love Boat&amp;rdquo; is a summer camp to learn Chinese in Taiwan) when I was 16! It was my first experience of independence, going to this country to learn Chinese and having the time of my life. It was a rite of passage into adulthood, and we got up to all sorts of mischief. Some of my friends now are still friends from back then. About Love Boat  The opportunity for my husband and daughter to fall in love with Taiwan for themselves was important for me. And hearing our daughter speak and sing her first Mandarin words was almost monumental because I grew up as a third culture kid in New York who never wanted to speak Chinese (until I was much older).Then there&amp;rsquo;s the variety. Food is always a celebration – whether we have our daily streetside Fantuan or venture out of the way to have the perfect stinky tofu stall (which Vinc loves more than I do). And lastly, the mix of urban living with nature helped us balance life a little easier. We toured the island, swam on the beaches, cycled in Sun Moon Lake, hiked Alishan to see the sunrise, soaking in the hot springs, and even joined a weekly hiking class in Taipei for 4-6-year-olds where we saw some of the most amazing scenery from the surrounding mountains. What does your husband think about Taiwan?  He thinks it&amp;rsquo;s amazing. It took him some time to find his own tribe of people working in sustainable architecture, but luckily he found them. Each introduction led him to another and the more he connected with them to learn about passion and share industry secrets (often with a translator), he realized that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a foreigner in another country.   Close           He also found it safe and easy to get around with the help of instant translation apps. Now, he could take our daughter around town on his own to their favorite hangouts like the skate park in Nangang ;) We were blown away by how many kids in Taiwan are on inline skates. They fit right in! What is your favorite thing to do in Taiwan?  It really depends on how long I am spending in Taiwan. If it&amp;rsquo;s a short trip, it&amp;rsquo;s all about the local breakfasts, night markets, and my favorite, those little stationery stores. I always buy stationery items that I don&amp;rsquo;t need and will never use because they&amp;rsquo;re just so precious. For example, look at these Mahjong post-its notes shows post-it notes or these German-themed ones with Wurst and pretzels. And this edamame keychain that has smiling edamame you squeeze out laughs.   Close           This time we had the opportunity to stay such a long time, and it gave us the freedom to just do more than we had hoped for. In the beginning, I wanted to do something every day, explore the whole island, but then we could slow down and picnic or laze by the beach with friends.   Close            Do you think there are work opportunities for you in Taiwan?  Yes, I was hoping to do some work in Taiwan since I can adapt to local market needs and provide strategies to small non-profits and large international hotel chains alike. Even with COVID, there is work for hotels and hospitality businesses to assess their business models. For me, there&amp;rsquo;s always work to find! In the absence of Taiwan-based clients, I loved the opportunity to speak to junior high and high school students at both local and international schools about life, careers, risks, travel, and much more. Vinc and I both spoke at the Taipei European School, and I had a separate presentation at a local Junior High School in Taoyuan. It&amp;rsquo;s experiences like this that are sometimes more rewarding than work.   Close            What is something that you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect from Taiwan before living here for an extended period of time?  We knew we&amp;rsquo;d find peers working in global innovation professionally – in fact, we would have been surprised if we didn&amp;rsquo;t meet changemakers along the way. But to list the things that did surprise us along the way would take hours to talk about.   Close           As a family, we didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to find micro-communities that shared our personal family interests. By chance, we found a children&amp;rsquo;s hiking class thanks to someone who was selling his used car seat. Our families became fast friends, and the hiking class became instrumental in our experience in Taiwan. The instructor is an amazing individual who wants nothing more than to teach our tiny 4-6 years old how to be responsible human beings. Then we found a small play-based &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo; beside our local park that focuses on personal growth and community. Both groups aligned with our style of parenting, and we loved it.   Close           We also didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to attend my father&amp;rsquo;s solo exhibit at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, which featured 66 paintings he painted since COVID started!   Close              Close            What are your future plans?  We would love to go back to Taiwan. My Gold Card is valid for another 3 years or so, and we are definitely open to going back and working there. And now that my daughter can speak Chinese, we definitely want to return so she can keep it up. The last thing we tried to do before leaving was getting my husband his own Gold Card. Do you have anything else you would like to add or say? Husband Vinc appears in the call  Vinc: &amp;ldquo;My time in Taiwan was very special. I mean, from a parent&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&amp;rdquo;Yvette: &amp;ldquo;He loved spending time with my parents!&amp;rdquo;Vince: &amp;ldquo;Uh, both laugh What I am saying is from a parent&amp;rsquo;s perspective, it was amazing. All these playgrounds everywhere, how open people are, and those little groups we&amp;rsquo;ve bumped into, like the hiking class. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what it would be like without having kids, so I can&amp;rsquo;t judge. But Taipei is a super place, the country is beautiful, and the food is great.Yvette: &amp;ldquo;What we also wanted to do was move down to maybe Taitung for a little bit. Or spend more time in Hualien. We had this vision of going down to Taitung for 6 months, so hopefully, in the future, this will work out.&amp;rdquo;   Close           ","tags":[],"categories":[],"href":"/en/why-taiwan/from-new-york-to-indonesia-to-formosa-life-as-a-digital-nomad-in-taiwan/"},{"title":"From one month runway to 300% growth - the US/Taiwan startup story of Han Jin &amp; Lucid","content":"  From one month runway to 300% growth - the US/Taiwan startup story of Han Jin &amp;amp; Lucid  Han Jin, emigrated to Germany from China at age 6. He grew up in Hamburg, and received his BSc in Management Science &amp;amp; General Engineering from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. He then finished his Masters in Engineering from the University of California in Berkeley in 2012.After working as a program manager at SanDisk for three years, Han began his dream of being an entrepreneur, founding Lucid in 2015, an computer vision company in California. He was recognized for his accomplishments in Forbes 30 under 30 and Inc 30 Under 30 for consumer technology in 2018.Han first came to Taiwan as part of the Garage&#43; program, joining their first batch of oversea entrepreneurs, and fell in love with Taiwan. He now spends his time managing Lucid’s cross-border teams in Taipei, Taiwan and San Jose, USA. Here is his story. How did you hear about Taiwan?  Back in Silicon Valley, I had heard about some Taiwan startup programs through outreach project managers (which were sponsored by the Ministry of Science &amp;amp; Technology). So in 2015, I joined the first batch from Garage&#43;, and then also joined the Sparklabs Taipei program at Taiwan Tech Arena in 2018. Through these programs I was able to find hardware manufacturing partners such as Wistron who produced Lucid’s first 3D camera, and develop products which were in partnership with RED in their Hydrogen One smartphone.At the time, I was still spending most of my time with the team in San Jose, but being brought up in a Chinese family, the language and food in Taiwan was familiar. I did have some culture shock coming from the US though. There were just so many rules, where in the US we were taught to question rules and find arbitrage, in Taiwan, people follow the rules to the T, and sometimes that stands in the way of finding innovation outside the box.But over time I figured out how to work within the system. I enjoyed the lifestyle here, transportation was so convenient, the people were friendly, and with the company’s needs for a strong hardware partner, I decided to set up a subsidiary of the US Lucid here. The low cost of living in addition to the excellent standard of living is key to the success of startup teams without much funding.   Close            When did you hear about the gold card?  I heard about the Gold Card through a friend, and received my card in July 2018. I’m now on my second card (renewed in April 2020) and it’s been a lifesaver! It has allowed me to settle here completely, work, and most importantly, I’m treated basically like a citizen. During Covid last year, I even received facemasks from the government.I’ve since met my Taiwanese fiancé here, bought a house in Xindian, and besides business trips to manage the team in the US, I will be based here. How has it been running a startup? Especially during Covid?  It’s extremely difficult! Lucid almost died three times over the past years, the worst was when we only had one month of cash left. But somehow, and always during Christmas, I’ve been able to either find an investor, land a large corporate contract, or somehow manage to find customer growth. That’s the nature of startups, one winter I’m having to let people go, and then all of a sudden, we are experiencing 300% month on month growth! We call it the “Christmas wonders.”During Covid, we have had to pivot into more software-based services focusing on video content. Taiwan has been crucial for this, as it was safe enough for me to meet with my team in the office and hire more talents here, when the US was on lockdown.   Close            How has it been setting up and managing teams in two countries? How are the two teams different?  I started the Taiwan team with just 2 people, growing it to 10 and now have about 20 people in total. We are now also hiring!Two-thirds of the company is actually in Taiwan now, and more than 80% of the company are engineers. There’s a balance of people in both teams, and I believe in combining the strengths of the Taiwan team with the US team for achieving the best results.In general, the culture in Taiwan focuses on linear execution, delivering products, developing features within tight schedules. They are exceptional in building technology and deep in their own crafts, but often people don’t strive to standout. The team spirit is also very strong, probably due to the cultural emphasis on family. In the US, the team has other priorities and often they want to be different and creative with their solutions. Therefore, they focus more on research and strategy.   Close            How has it been hiring in Taiwan compared to the US?  The interview process is really different. In the US, Silicon Valley encourages big thinking, but also deep dive very quickly on a specific use case. Interviews usually include creative questions that challenges your abilities to solve a unknown problem on the spot. In Taiwan, the interviews are more generic, there is a lot of focus on standardized testing and technical abilities.Language can also still be a barrier though, if candidates are not comfortable in English, they cannot present themselves, making it difficult to be attractive for US recruiters.Finding talent in Taiwan is very different than in the US, as people follow a sort of herd mentality here. You have to tap into certain engineering circles for hiring. I brought over the previous GM of a mobile tech company, and relied heavily on him to bring over his previous peers. Thank you for sharing your experiences, Han. Any last thoughts?  In a startup, I had to try so many things that failed, and to this day I still fail every day. However, I never regret quitting my well-paid stable corporate job to jump into this adventure. At the end of the day, you will realize that a big salary does not define happiness, but what you do with your limited amount of time in life. Even though to most people, quitting my well-paid corporate job was the most stupid decision and yet, I feel it was the best decision, because sometimes you have to just take a risk on yourself as life is too short.We are currently looking to expand and need to hire a lot of engineers. There are some exciting news coming for Lucid soon that I can’t announce yet. So, if there are any engineers and developers looking to join our adventure, please contact me!If you are interested in working for Lucid, please contact: hr@lucidinside.com   CakeResume details  ","tags":[],"categories":[],"href":"/en/why-taiwan/from-one-month-runway-to-300-growth-the-us-taiwan-startup-story-of-han-jin-lucid/"},{"title":"Front-end Engineer","content":"Must Have Bachelor with 5 years of industrial experience in front-end design, or Master in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science with 3-years of experience in the relevant areas. hands-on experience in building web applications using jQuery, BootstrapReact, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, AJAX, JSON, webpack, etc. Optional/Plus Experience in “Responsive Design” implementations.

How do I complete the online declaration?A4.Step 1: Scan the QR-Code with your smartphone or click HERE  .Step 2: Enter information into each field in order to complete the online declaration.Step 3: After arriving in Taiwan, turn on your phone and an electronic health declaration receipt will be sent to your phone via SMS.Step 4: Go to the place where you should provide your quarantine notice, and show your health declaration receipt on your mobile phone for verification by the on-site personnel. Q5. If my smartphone does not have Internet access, can I still use the Entry Quarantine System?A5. Yes. As long as your phone number can send and receive SMS, you can use the free Wi-Fi provided by the airport, connect to the Entry Quarantine System, and complete the online declaration. Upon completion, the system will send a SMS to your mobile phone. Q6. Can individuals share mobile phones?A6. For the purpose of community e-tracking care, inbound passengers are required to have a phone number of a telecom service provider in Taiwan (a SIM card can be purchased at the airport in Taiwan) and to use their personal mobile phone (1 person, 1 phone) to make the health declaration. However, special circumstances such as if the passenger is under 12 years old or if the passengers will undergo home quarantine in the same location, they can complete the health declaration through a shared mobile phone. Q7. I have been living abroad for a long time and my Taiwan SIM card is not working or has been deactivated, what should I do?A7. You can apply for a new SIM card to a telecom service provider on site (near the place where you submit your quarantine notice) or apply to reactivate your SIM card. Q8. Why can&amp;rsquo;t I receive the SMS? How do I solve this problem?A8. If you have correctly completed the declaration form on the Entry Quarantine System, you will not receive a SMS until you arrive in Taiwan. If you have arrived in Taiwan and still have not received a SMS, please follow the steps below to troubleshoot the problem: Confirm that all your personal information is accurate   Make sure that the passport number or travel document number listed on the Entry Quarantine System is consistent with the document number used when purchasing the flight ticket. Before submitting the form, double-check that the mobile phone number entered into the Entry Quarantine System is correct. If you are not an R.O.C. (Taiwan) Citizen, please click the &amp;ldquo;No Passport Click Here&amp;rdquo; button for your ID card/resident certificate ID card No./ARC No. This will automatically fill in your passport number.   SMS sending and receiving settings on your mobile phone   Please make sure that your phone can make/receive calls and send/receive SMS. If your phone is set to Airplane Mode during the flight, please turn off Airplane Mode and restart your phone to send and receive SMS again. Please check if your phone&amp;rsquo;s brand/model has a SMS filtering function, such as the Huawei phone (Call Settings → Menu →Harassment Filter) or Xiaomi phone (Security Center → Harassment Filter → Settings).   Please ask the airport quarantine personnel to use the troubleshoot function. After confirming your passport number, name, and other information, a SMS will be sent to you.   Q9. If I assist my family members with filling out the declaration form on a computer before boarding, will I receive a text message?A9. Passengers must use their smartphone to fill out the online declaration within 48 hours before the plane arrives in Taiwan, only then will they receive the SMS when arriving in Taiwan. If you do not receive the SMS when you arrive, please contact the airport quarantine personnel for assistance. Q10. If I have an international roaming mobile phone number, why do I need to apply for a domestic number when entering Taiwan?A10. If your mobile phone has international roaming, you will receive SMS, but the roaming number cannot effectively be used to carry out personal health care and tracking after you enter the country. Therefore, inbound passengers must apply for a Taiwan mobile phone number to facilitate management and support care services provided by the civil affairs bureau and local borough chief. Individuals must use a Taiwan mobile phone number to make a health declaration and receive an electronic health declaration receipt. If you do not have a Taiwan mobile phone number, you can make the declaration with your international roaming number before you depart (an overseas station of the airline company). Once you arrive in Taiwan, you need to purchase a SIM card from a Taiwan telecom service provider at the airport and activate it before entering the country.   Q11. For passengers arriving in Taiwan from a third place via connecting flight, which flight number should be entered into the Entry Quarantine System?A11. According to current regulations, passengers should use their mobile phone to complete the declaration on the Entry Quarantine System before boarding their plane. Therefore, passengers should provide the flight number from the place of departure (not place of transit) on the Entry Quarantine System. For example, if a passenger departs from Paris, France on flight MM99, then transfers in Hong Kong and takes flight KK123 to Taiwan, the passenger should select France for the Country/Region of Departure and provide the flight number of your departure (MM99).For more information, please click the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control’s Home → COVID-19 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) → FAQs → Quarantine System for Entry  ","tags":["COVID 19"],"categories":[],"href":"/en/faq/how-do-i-use-the-quarantine-system-for-entry/"},{"title":"How do my parents apply for Visitor Visas?","content":"Your parents must visit the National Immigration Agency’s website  to learn about the application process and apply online through Online System  .","tags":["Hong Kong \u0026 Macau Residents"],"categories":[],"href":"/en/faq/how-do-my-parents-apply-for-visitor-visas-1/"},{"title":"How do we define &#39;an individual who does not have household registration in the R.O.C. and is not a resident of the R.O.C. in accordance with the Income Tax Act&#39;?","content":"This refers to an individual who has no household registration in the R.O.C. and stays less than 183 days within each year (1/1~12/31).","tags":["Tax"],"categories":[],"href":"/en/faq/eligible-to-apply-for-the-tax-incentives/"},{"title":"How do we define the specific point of time for counting the &#39;first 3 years&#39; when a foreign special professional&#39;s salary income exceeds NT$3,000,000 and is eligible for the tax incentives?","content":"The term &amp;ldquo;first 3 years&amp;rdquo; in the tax incentives shall start from the year when the foreign special professional has resided in the R.O.C. for 183 days or more for the first time, and has an annual salary income over NT$3,000,000.

Finding work or starting a business in Taiwan is challenging, and to succeed you need all the guanxi (關係) that you can get. You need access to people who have done it before, can highlight pitfalls and obstacles, and are willing to offer a little friendly advice. This is what creating good connections, or guanxi, is all about.Below is a culmination of tips on how to take the first steps toward building a network of connections, both international and local, that will impact you professionally and personally. Finding the right network is crucial for your career in Taiwan, and we hope that this article will aid you on your journey to broadening your professional network.   Close            TIP 1: BE HONEST ABOUT YOUR INTENTIONS  Be honest about what outcomes you want to achieve long term, and be clear and upfront about your goals for networking.Whether you are seeking internships, mentors, business advice, visa advice, potential business prospects, or a new career, it&amp;rsquo;s best to be direct about your intentions from the start. Be honest with yourself first, so you can be sincere to those in your network.   Close            TIP 2: MAKE A LIST OF THE TYPES OF PEOPLE YOU WANT TO MEET  Your time is finite, and so is the time of people you connect with. Networking requires time, effort, and planning, so try to identify the types of people you would like to focus your networking on.Think about potential hiring managers, specific VC’s, other senior leaders or experts in your desired field. Growing your network in terms of relevant quality is better than growing it in terms of random quantity.For instance, as a job seeker, identify the companies that you would like to work for, that align with your values, and where you can see yourself growing professionally. Take a look at job postings on job boards (or even Facebook) and start cross-referencing HR staff on LinkedIn, if you’d like to directly enquire about relevant opportunities.   Close            TIP 3: UTILIZE LINKEDIN  LinkedIn is one of the most important social media platforms for professionals in Taiwan, especially for those new to Taiwan. In addition, although professional communities and networks thrive on Facebook, it is not recommended to approach contacts of interest on Facebook. Conversely, on LinkedIn, adding connections of interest who you have had no previous contact with is permissible.Being active on the platform is paramount to expanding your professional network in an efficient and organized manner. Make sure that your LinkedIn profile is complete and professional. Try referring to the profiles of the people you are interested in, this will make you think critically about the first impressions you are projecting, and whether your profile represents you in an accurate and professional manner.For the purposes of compiling a shortlist, use the ‘Connections’ button and click search with filters. If you are looking to start a business, search for Founders and CEOs in your desired industry, who work in fields and areas closely related to yours. On the other hand, as a job seeker you can search for the profiles of hiring managers at the companies you are interested in. Search for relevant professional groups and keep an eye out for online and offline events.Next, you can invite connections with a short note like this:‘Hi XXXX, thanks for the connection, I am looking for XXXX and was wondering if I could ask for a moment of your time to discuss XXXX.’   Close            TIP 4: MAKE TIME FOR COFFEE  When you have established the connection and the conversation is flowing online, try to organize an in-person coffee, or at least an online chat. For good guanxi, it is important to seem like a genuine human being, so aim to have a conversation in person so that you can create a good impression.Message the contact to see where is convenient for them, and whether they recommend any cafe or restaurant nearby. Be clear to yourself and the other person about the goal of the meeting. Make sure you do not waste the other person’s time for your own benefit. Good professional networks are small and bad reputations spread fast.   Close            TIP 5: ASK NICELY AND LISTEN  There are no special techniques to professional networking that you can’t learn or draw from every day socializing. Some people feel that in order to seem professionally attractive, they must present an idealized version of themselves. However, this may backfire and make you seem disingenuous and projecting a fake image. Do not try to be something you are not. Relax and actively listen to whoever you are connecting with. Not only is this an easier way to communicate, but it also maximizes your chances of discovering genuine alignment and connection.Note that networking does not work well when you directly ask your connections for a job or help. Stating your intention for a meeting is quite different from asking for something that you’re unsure that connection can give. Being too direct may come off as being too pushy, or even worse, obviously treating that person as a means to an end.A good professional impression of yourself should not be of desperation, but of someone who genuinely wants to engage as a human being, and also is keen to offer rather than just take. If you have some skill or resource that might be of value to them, it never hurts to offer something in return, this way you are extending an exchange of value, even if that person declines your offer.Try asking whether they know of resources or people that may be able to help, or relate and ask whether they have experienced your current challenges. Make it a dialogue and ask for their opinion and advice, instead of requesting that they help.   Close            TIP 6: FOLLOW UP AND PLAY THE LONG GAME  The only way to maintain a connection is by following up. If you are struggling with conversation, focus on referencing a specific topic from your conversation before and offer help and advice. The best professional connections are made by being nice, offering something in return and not asking for too much. Don’t give the impression that you are going to discard a connection once you have taken what you need at the time.Don’t just collect connections and then look them up when you really need something. Like any relationship, professional connections need care and attention, or the relationship will simply wither and die. It is rare that you immediately gain something from meeting people for the first time, so manage your expectations. Time needs to be spent fostering relationships for the long term, not just for your most immediate need or crisis.Remember, whoever you meet out there professionally, don’t forget to ask their advice on what connections may be useful, what events are out there, etc.The next step is to get yourself out there.Written by Daniel Miller, co-founder of All Hands Taiwan and Taiwan Manager for Pagoda Projects.","tags":[],"categories":[],"href":"/en/why-taiwan/how-to-broaden-your-professional-network-in-taiwan/"},{"title":"How to Choose Professional Networking Events in Taipei?","content":"  How to Choose Professional Networking Events in Taipei?

After you receive your import permit, you can start looking for flights. We recommend booking them via call, so the airline can check directly if you can take a pet on board for that specific flight.   Some airlines allow pets in the cabin when they are small enough (e.g., KLM, Lufthansa) Some airlines only allow pets in cargo (e.g., Eva Air) Some airlines don&amp;rsquo;t allow certain types of pets at all (e.g., Emirates) Every airline&amp;rsquo;s pricing and rules are different. Please make sure to check on their websites or call for any questions.   Apply for a post-entry quarantine facility spot in Taiwan   After receiving your import permit and booking your flight, you will need to apply for the post-entry quarantine facility. Email your area&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan branch office to arrange for a quarantine spot. Contacts can be found HERE  .   Finding the right carriage  Whether you are transporting the pet in the cabin or in cargo, you will have to look for the right transport carriage. For in-cabin flights, we recommend going for soft bags as they tend to have more space for the pet to move around. They can also be a little bigger than the airline standards, which makes it even more comfortable for your furry friend! If you are transporting your pet in cargo, the transportation cage needs to fit the IATA-standards. Make sure your carrier has enough space for the pet to comfortably stand up and move around.  NOTE: If you decided to transport the pet in a soft bag, you would still need a transport cage for transport to the quarantine facilities. You can bring it to the Taiwan airport previous to your flight or have a friend drop it off. Please go to the quarantine office at the port of entry to organize the drop-off. Please check out the shipping fare for transportation from the airport to the quarantine facilities HERE  .         Arrival Time  Please make sure your pet arrives during specific times so the transport to the quarantine facility can run smoothly. If you arrive outside of the official arrival time, your pet might need to stay at the airport overnight. Find the updated times HERE  . Scroll to the bottom and look for the &amp;ldquo;Arrival time for into the quarantine premise&amp;rdquo; document. Quarantine   Inquire at your Taiwan animal quarantine branch office which quarantine facilities your pet will be transported to After successful quarantine spot application, you should&amp;rsquo;ve been sent some info sheets to fill out regarding your pet&amp;rsquo;s detailed information; if not, inquire with your branch office Call or email the quarantine facilities to inquire about visiting times and when you can bring food or special items for the pets  After a 7-days quarantine, you can pick up your pet. Be aware that the time your pet spends at the quarantine facilities is very stressful, so give your pet a couple of days to recover!For more in-depth information about the whole quarantine process, please check out this DOCUMENT  . The branch offices are very friendly, helpful, speak English and are reachable via telephone or email. Find their contact info HERE  . Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to confirm every step of the process with them!Good luck, and see you in Taiwan soon!

One of the main reasons to open an association is to accept donations from corporate partners and reduce the obstacles to working with governmental organizations and other NGOs. If you’re interested in learning what it takes to create an Association, this article is for you.   Close            The Right Accountant is Crucial  It can take over a year to finalize an association if you choose the wrong accountant, when it really shouldn’t take longer than six months. It really comes down to the accountant you choose, so pick one who comes highly recommended by friends who have already opened their own companies. Unfortunately, a lot of accountants don’t have any actual experience in setting up an association, but may tell you that they can do it. Instead of wasting your time, find someone with a proven track record of establishing an association.   Close            Choose a Home for Your Organization  The accountant will ask if you want to incorporate in all of Taiwan or just Taipei.Incorporating as a city-based association in Taipei is a much easier process, and is the recommended option. By setting up in Taipei, you only need to prove that you have members in the Taipei area.To incorporate as a nationwide association, you need to prove that you have members all over Taiwan. If you’re considering founding an association, it is strongly recommended that you talk to people who have done it before to get an understanding of the membership workloads, because they are considerable.   Close            Bring Your Crew  Once you have established a location for your organization, the next step is to gather the signatures of your members. To be efficient, decide to gather close friends and your close network with an aligned mission. This is critically important.In order to legally establish an association in Taipei, you need to have at least 30 members willing to sign membership forms and who are in one of the following situations: Taiwanese with their household registration in Taipei, Foreigners with an ARC (Alien Resident Certificate) that shows that they live in Taipei, or Taiwanese or Foreigners who don’t live in Taipei but work there (which can be proven with a letter from their employer).  If a member lives in Taipei or has their household registration in Taipei, things are pretty easy; their address is printed on their Taiwanese ID, so that can be shown as proof of residence. However, if a member only works in Taipei, then they need to ask their employer to sign a letter affirming their employment within Taipei. Each member also has to sign a membership form and provide photos of their ID cards.On top of collecting the paperwork above, you need to require these members to attend two official meetings and sign-in at each meeting.For example, you can cater two events where your plans and vision for the association can be shared with new members and at the same time, collect their signatures. At least 50% of the members needs to attend each meeting, so it can become a little troublesome to get busy professionals in Taipei to adjust their schedules.Another key issue is that after its initial founding, a Taipei association needs to continue to hold two general member meetings every six months.In addition to compiling the association membership, the organization must select a group of board members and a group of audit committee members. The board is meant to be an advisory committee that can offer guidance and decision-making support to the organization and its initiatives, while the audit committee supervises the board and ensures the organization and its finances are in good standing.If all of this sounds a bit complicated, you can peruse the relevant documentation in Chinese  , or ask your accountant to help you get set up.   Close              Close            Pay the Man  With government filings in order, it is finally time to pay your hard-working accountant, which amounts to around NTD$120,000 for the set up and registration process. One other fee to consider is your mailing address. To set up an organization, you need to register a mailing address. If you have an office, you’re already set. However, if your organization is fully remote, you can elect to pay around NT $3,000 / month to rent an office space from a co-working space or business center.Monthly accounting services will probably cost around NT $ 3,000 – NT $ 4,000 per month.All in all, expenses should be around NTD$120,000 &#43; NTD$36,000 = NTD$156,000 for a first year of administration, but of course fees will vary according to each organization.   Close            Adventures in Taiwanese Banking  The next logical step entails opening a bank account. There’s no legal requirement regulating which bank an association must choose, but E. Sun Bank has an English-friendly website, and is the only bank that Paypal funds can be transferred to in Taiwan. With newly-minted association documents and chop seals in hand, you can go to your bank of choice and open the association bank account. The bank account MUST be opened at the bank branch closest to your association office address. Please note that this is a fairly minor consideration, as later you can bank at any branch, but when setting up your accounts, be prepared to visit the branch nearest your registered address.   Close            Welcome to the Goody Room  Now that your association is legally established, you can apply for deals that are only available to non-profit organizations. A lot of deals with foreign tech companies can be found via TechSoup Taiwan  . Create a profile, upload your association founding documents, and after verification by TechSoup Taiwan, you can register to get Slack Pro, Google Workspace, and other services for free for your org, while also gaining access to discount offers from Zoom and other services. While this should not be a motivation for setting up the association, it is certainly nice to get some goodies back for all the effort.This article was reviewed by the accountants at Del Sol CPA &amp;amp; Associates 德碩會計師事務所.Written by Daniel Miller, co-founder of All Hands Taiwan and Taiwan Manager for Pagoda Projects.","tags":[],"categories":[],"href":"/en/why-taiwan/how-to-set-up-an-association-in-taiwan-a-case-study/"},{"title":"How to upload supplementary documents?","content":"Case Status Check → The List of Supplemental Documents → View → Modify → Upload Document(Please confirm that you have uploaded the correct documents.

However, the &amp;ldquo;tax incentives for foreign special professionals&amp;rdquo; are restricted to the applicable year and with threshold of salary income.

You can even travel to major cities and attractions by different types of public transport. The following is a basic introduction to Taiwan’s various types of public transportation. Taiwan High-Speed Rail (HSR)  Since its official opening in 2007, the High-Speed Rail has become the fastest means of transportation in Taiwan, with stations located in 11 major cities, including Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung. Reaching high speeds of 300 kilometers per hour, it only takes 95 minutes to travel between Taipei and Kaohsiung. Tourists can wake up early, take the HSR from Taipei and arrive in Kaohsiung before noon, then take the Kaohsiung MRT and ferry to Qijin Fishing Port to enjoy some fresh seafood. If there’s time, on the way back through Taichung take a stroll through the famous Feng Chia Night Market for some more tasty delicacies. After eating and drinking your fill, you are ready to head home with a full belly and great memories.  Encino from zhwiki, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons    Close             Ticketing Info     Taiwan Railway  The long history of the Taiwan Railway is a common memory for many Taiwanese people. Though it may be slower than the HSR, the Taiwan Railway is an island-wide network that connects different cities and counties in the western and eastern regions of Taiwan. With 241 stations and relatively inexpensive fares, it remains one of the most convenient and popular forms of public transportation, especially during the holidays when many locals need to return home.The Taiwan Railways&#39; train ride around the island is a very popular attraction. Tourists can witness the splendid views of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s cities and admire the beautiful scenery of its countryside, all from the comfort of their well-designed and spacious train. The most charming part of the ride is the East Rift Valley (also known as the Huadong Valley). During the Spring, tourists are treated to a sea of wild flowers scattered across the mountainside; in the Autumn during harvest season, they can witness an abundance of wheat ears, glistening under the sun. Regardless of what season it is, the thriving and vibrant life of Taiwan’s countryside is apparent. For tourists who wish to travel on the Taiwan Railway during long holidays, especially the Eastern Route trains, please remember to book your tickets in advance as tickets sell out fast!   Close             Ticketing Info     Charter Bus System  Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s Charter Bus System is also very well-developed, with prices cheaper than the Taiwan Railway. However, unlike the Taiwan Railway, aside from a few major metropolitan areas, most stops are located near highway interchanges, far from the city. Therefore, if you decide to take a charter bus, it is likely that you will need to arrange for another ride later.Currently, there are many charter bus companies in Taiwan, such as Kuo-Kuang eBus, United Highway Bus (Ubus), Ho-Hsin eBus, Kamalan Bus, Hsinchu Bus, etc. It may be daunting at first for foreigners to determine which bus company best fits their need, but just remember that aside from Kuo-Kuang eBus, each bus company has specific cities in which they operate, so the easiest way to decide is to choose from the departure and arrival cities. In order to promote tourism and remedy the insufficiencies of the existing highway charter bus system, the Tourism Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications of Taiwan launched the Taiwan Tourist Shuttle bus service in 2010 to shuttle passengers to and from nearby major Taiwan Railway and HSR stations. As long as you time it right, you can almost always catch a ride, making it one of the most popular means of transportation for backpackers.  From Tourism Bureau    Close             List of Charter Bus Companies    Taiwan Tourist Shuttle     Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)  Bright and clean MRT cars have become the new standard for modern cities. There are currently five MRT systems in Taiwan: Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taoyuan, New Taipei and Taichung, listed in order of their establishment. If the MRT is your main mode of transportation, it is more cost-effective to purchase a monthly pass. In addition, to ensure the comfort of passengers and keep the MRT cars clean, no food or drink is allowed in the station or on the trains. The Taipei Mass Rapid Transit, branded as the Taipei Metro, was the first MRT to be established in Taiwan, and has since developed six different lines covering almost the entire Taipei metropolitan area, allowing many landmarks and popular attractions to be accessible by MRT. The furthest north you can travel by MRT is Danshui, the south is Xindian Bitan, the west to Xinzhuang or Tucheng, and the east to Nangang, where the first professional large-scale, double-story exhibition hall in Taiwan is located - the go-to venue for many major international exhibitions. With such a well-connected network and trains that almost are never delayed, the Taipei Metro definitely ranks as one of the top metro systems internationally.The Kaohsiung MRT was officially opened in 2008, and currently has three main lines: the Red Line, the Orange Line, and the Circular Light Rail Line. It also connects the Zuoying Station in the north to the Kaohsiung International Airport in the south. Well-known stations include Formosa Boulevard, Weiwuying, Central Park, and Sizihwan. Formosa Boulevard station is renowned for its beautiful &amp;ldquo;Dome of Light&amp;rdquo; stained glass art display, the world’s largest public art installation made from pieces of colored glass. In addition to the 3 lines mentioned, the Kaohsiung MRT continues to propose plans to increase the number of lines and stations, moving towards the ideal of a 30-minute living circle in Greater Kaohsiung.The Taoyuan MRT is the third MRT system in operation, with network that covers three cities: Taipei City, New Taipei City and Taoyuan City. The Airport MRT is connected to the Taipei Metro, making it easy for inbound and outbound passengers to get to Taipei in about 30 minutes by direct train.The New Taipei and Taichung MRT systems were opened later. The New Taipei MRT is mainly operated by theTaipei Metro Corporation, and consists of the Danhai Light Rail, Ankeng Light Rail, and Sanying Line. Currently, only the Danhai Light Rail is in operation. The Taichung MRT consists of the Green, Blue, and Orange Line, with only the Green Line (Wurih-Wunsin-Beitun line) currently being in operation, and connects the Taichung HSR station with City Hall.   Close             Taipei Metro Info    Taichung Metro Info    Kaohsiung Metro Info    New Taipei City Metro Info    Taoyuan Airport Metro Info     City Bus  City buses are the most common yet indispensable means of public transportation in all cities. Many people choose city buses as their main means of transportation because of their frequency, convenience, and number of stops.All counties and cities in Taiwan have a city bus system, with Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung having the most developed and concentrated bus routes. In order to encourage the public to take the bus more often, each county and city offers special discount programs from time to time, such as Taichung’s Double 10 Bus Fare Scheme, and the Taipei Fun Pass, so you can travel the entire city without having to drive yourself.Your EasyCard is accepted on the city bus so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to pay with change.   Close             Taipei City Bus Info    Taichung City Bus Info    Tainan City Bus Info    Kaohsiung City Bus Info     Public Bicycles (You-Bike/E-Bike/City Bike/ iBike/ T-Bike)  Public bicycles have frequently been seen as a way to solve the “last mile” problem, and connect users between public transit networks and their final destination. Since 2008, Taipei and other major cities have been promoting public bicycles and setting up more docking stations to conserve energy, reduce the city’s carbon footprint, and encourage a healthy lifestyle with exercise.Due to the increase of cyclists, the city has gradually begun to change its traffic system to ensure cyclists’ safety and right-of-way. For example, Taipei City has reduced car lanes just to make room for more bike lanes. Currently, most of the major public bicycles in the country are manufactured by Giant, Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s number one bicycle brand. Some regions even entrust Giant to operate their bicycles. The design of the bike is very user-friendly, complete with wide seats and 3-speed gear shift. The ability to pay with an EasyCard (or other similar cards), makes it very convenient and highly praised.

There are many ways to hail a taxi, such as phoning for one, using an app, or just stopping one on the street. In addition to the common taxi companies such as Taiwan Taxi and Metro Taxi, in recent years, technological innovation and advancements have led to the rise of new era taxis, such as Uber, Line Taxi, and Yoxi, diversifying the options for riders. Taxi companies will also offer special discount fares from time to time, and riders can pay by cash or credit, something that is convenient for both locals and foreigners.

While finding a new opportunity can seem daunting, there are a few things you can do to ensure that you are searching efficiently and effectively. In this article, we list a few pointers on how to find professional opportunities in Taiwan. Where should I look?  As with job searches in any country, one should canvas far and wide. Here’s a list of some of the best-known online resources:  Job Search Websites 104.com Yourator CakeResume LinkedIn Glassdoor    Facebook Groups Working in Taiwan – The largest group for (foreigner-focused) employment in Taiwan Non-Teaching Jobs in Taiwan – A large, active group dedicated to connecting job seekers and companies with openings Non-Teaching Jobs in Kaohsiung – Job-seeking group focused on Kaohsiung and Southern Taiwan    In addition to this list, you can use LinkedIn to connect with recruiters and current employees of companies you are interested in. If your home country has a trade office or chamber of commerce in Taiwan, check with them as well. Search regularly for upcoming job fairs.   Close            How long does it take to find a job?  Finding a job in Taiwan often takes longer than expected. As frustrating as this can be, do your best to manage this time proactively. You may need to consider taking part-time roles, volunteering, or doing an internship. The tricky combination of a low number of openings for each field, an abundance of competing job seekers, and unpredictable hiring processes and periods can significantly prolong your job search. It can be helpful to discuss your experiences with friends to share tips and learn from one another’s experiences. How much will/should you be paid?  This is a never-ending debate that for many seems to only ever be answered as “not enough.” The exception here is for high-demand, highly-skilled talent such as mobile engineers, who can command a premium. Regardless of the job and your skillset, you’ll do well to negotiate for the highest salary you can secure. The good news is that with 12-18 months of experience working in Taiwan on your resume, you will be in a position to negotiate for a significant raise at your next job(s). For experienced and managerial candidates, salaries vary widely, so it is advised that you do your research and negotiate the best deal possible. Any final tips?  Networking is the most important thing one can do to find work in Taiwan. This is true not only for your first job here but also for freelance work and future roles. While it is certainly possible to secure a job without much networking, it’s advised that you expand and engage your professional network as much as you can. Job offers and partnerships can arise from unexpected places and occasions. Go to happy hours, go to job fairs, and consider staying in touch with that person you chat with at the café or bar may also be looking for a career change. Every connection you make could be key to building your career here.

They pay special attention to be respectful in social interaction whether it be their words or deeds. Here are some basic business etiquette to guarantee you smooth sailing in business settings or with friends and family. Greetings     Close            Names and titles are very important and it is customary to exchange business cards upon introduction. Keep extra business cards in your wallet at all times, and it&amp;rsquo;s best to have cards with both Chinese and English. After shaking hands, present your business card with both hands to the other person. Do not throw your card on the table and always try to give a card if you receive one. A nod or a slight bow is considered polite for the first meeting, while handshakes are generally only for males who are friends. Introductions are important. Always wait for a third person to introduce you. If at a party or business meeting, wait for the host to introduce you. Punctuality is appreciated, but being a few minutes early or late is acceptable. Many greetings include the question, “Have you eaten?” as a polite inquiry.   Meetings     Close            Business people in Taiwan are hard bargainers and may try to gain concessions by wearing the other party down. Be patient and do not push too hard or fast. If possible, bring a team of 2-4 people (one senior individual with decision-making power). This enhances the status and image of executives and reflects on the seriousness of the meeting. Decisions are made collectively and can be a lengthy process during negotiation. Once facts are established, agreements can sometimes be reached quickly. 關係 or guan-xi means connections/personal relationships. Guan-xi is vital for business success in Taiwan. Taiwanese business people will want to know you personally before they do business with you.   Dining and Entertainment     Close            To be successful in Taiwan, one must master the Art of Entertaining. Entertaining should never be regarded as a waste of time and choosing the right restaurant is vital and can greatly enhance your chances of success. Dining in Taiwan can be elaborate and exhausting with as many as twenty courses at a banquet, meaning that business dinners can go late into the night. Be sure to arrive on time or early for a banquet. Do not discuss business at dinner unless your hosts bring it up. Toasting is common and is often made before and during meals. Toasting is done with wine or liquor. The host begins by raising their glass with two hands, with one hand supporting the bottom of the glass. If your Taiwan host wishes to toast with you and passes you an empty glass, rest assured that it will be filled by one of the hosts. You are expected to toast your host and drink the contents of the glass. The guest of honor is the first to sample any dish brought to the table. Be sure to taste the food immediately as everyone else will wait for you to finish before they eat. The host will place food on the guests&#39; plates. Each person can help themselves to any additional food by placing a small amount of food from a variety of dishes into their individual rice bowl. Place your rice bowl close to your face while eating, but leave plates on the table. Place your chopsticks together on the table or on the chopstick rest when you are finished. Never stick your chopsticks vertically into a bowl. Never place bones or seeds in your rice bowl. If a plate is not provided for this purpose, place them on the table. The host (person who has invited everyone) always pays the bill. It is polite for the guest to offer to pay, but don&amp;rsquo;t insist.   Attire     Close            The Taiwanese place a heavy emphasis on dressing neatly and conservatively. Men tend to wear suits, while women wear conservative business attire, such as a loose skirt and blouse. Making a good first impression is vital. Avoid wearing t-shirts, jeans, and other casual attire to first meetings. Even while attending a casual activity, you should dress modestly. Your clothing should be neat, clean, and unwrinkled.   Gifts     Close            Present and receive gifts with both hands and do not open them in front of the giver. Recipients may refuse a gift to be polite, but politely persist until the gift is accepted. Custom requires people to reciprocate with a gift of equal value. Gifts should be wrapped with great care, and the container and wrapping of the gift is as important as the gift itself.   Body Language     Close            Do not touch anyone, especially a baby, on the top of their head. Affection for the opposite sex is not shown in public. Never use your feet to move an object or to point as feet are considered dirty. Place your hands in your lap when sitting. Men should not cross their legs, but rather place both feet on the floor. Putting an arm around someone&amp;rsquo;s shoulder, winking, and pointing with your index finger are all considered rude gestures. You may point with an open hand. Palms facing outward and in front of the face moving back and forth means &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;. Nervous movements, such as tapping your foot, are considered rude. Accept food and other objects with both hands to indicate respect. Be humble if you receive a compliment. Family is central in Taiwanese culture, so it is polite to inquire about someone’s family.

Whether you are beginning a new job in a Taiwanese company, starting your own company, or simply engaging with businesses in Taiwan on a professional level, this article aims to explain four of the most common cultural distinctions that define a Taiwanese workplace.   Giving Feedback       Close           Workplaces in different cultures are uniquely nuanced in the ways they communicate feedback—positive or negative. What stands out in a Taiwanese workplace? Non-confrontation.Taiwan is a non-confrontational culture, so a direct and opinionated approach may fall short with colleagues and management. Negative comments or criticisms between colleagues, particularly between a manager and subordinates, can be awkward and embarrassing for everyone involved. Avoid giving negative feedback in front of a large group of people at all costs. This is where the concept of “face” is especially important, and any interaction that results in a colleague or business partner losing face can irreversibly damage relations.This cultural nuance requires that an individual have a firm grasp of the context in which things are said: be sensitive to your tone, your words, and your seniority. For instance, criticism of others, however constructive, is a major faux-pas in team meetings in Taiwan. This can easily be misconstrued as an attempt to humiliate a colleague in front of the rest of the team and draw positive attention to yourself. However, praise in front of a large group of people is certainly welcomed.You will more often experience criticism or feedback being expressed via text or email. While this can be a means to avoid confrontation in the short term, it is recommended that a face-to-face discussion is arranged ASAP in order to avoid potential longer-term misunderstandings. Tersely written arguments can be interpreted in a different way than intended, so it is in your interest to clearly communicate feedback or criticism in person. Furthermore, in-person communication provides you the platform to explain again (and again!) if you can see there is a misunderstanding.  Handling Hierarchy       Close           Intimately related to the above concept of “face” is the notion of hierarchy within a workplace—your position and the relative position of the individual you are communicating with determines how a message is received.If you are part of a local team, it is important to understand that if someone senior to you gives you a task, you are expected to carry out the task exactly as instructed. Another common misstep that foreign professionals in Taiwan are prone to is sharing an opinion or suggestion for improvement to a line manager. If you do this too early in your relationship, it could be interpreted as criticism or even arrogance.Seniority is to be respected and abided by. In addition, when hierarchical systems are present in a workplace, it can cause an employee to feel that they are being micromanaged, or that obedience is expected above all else. Thus, keeping a strong and even personal relationship with your boss is key to long-term success within a company—it is important to give the impression that you are an ally.On the other hand, if you are doing business with a Taiwanese company, it is in your best interest to find the person who can make executive decisions, as it may feel like communicating with someone lower down the hierarchy can delay communication. Establish a connection, or guanxi, with someone who has the power to make decisions as soon as possible.  Guanxi       Close           Echoing the point made above about being liked by your boss, establishing deeper connections will contribute to longer-term professional success. Guanxi loosely translates as personal connections, relationships, or social networks. Having good, bad, or no guanxi impacts one’s influence and ability to get things done.Being liked by all levels of a hierarchy will help you succeed. Although this point can be applied universally, in Taiwan it is especially true that a feel-good personal relationship can blossom into a fruitful professional relationship. This is not to say that you have to become close friends with all of your colleagues, but showing interest in their personal lives and building rapport is an excellent way to cultivate trust.Take some time to get to know your colleagues around you—you may notice quite personal questions being asked of you, but this is an indication that someone wants to establish deeper guanxi. Try to avoid gossip and controversial topics when you can, as impressions and reputations travel far and especially fast. Offering gifts is a common part of showing appreciation and respect to your colleagues, so prepare to bring something back if you go on a trip or a vacation.  Structure over Flexibility       Close           During the pandemic, it has become increasingly apparent that some established practices in Taiwanese work culture have been slow to change and are quite conservative compared to many companies globally. One such aspect is a lack of flexibility in work culture, and managers are often unable to trust their employees to work effectively from home, or according to their own patterns and methods. Seen another way, Taiwanese work culture can be seen as being entrenched in a culture of presenteeism, which means that employees must show up for 8 hours in the office (or more!) in order to be recognized for their efforts. This is one major adjustment that foreign professionals in Taiwan must adapt to. Productivity is measured in hours that one is present and supervised, and the prevalence of KPIs as a common performance metric is a reflection of this. As such, employee output and capability can sometimes be skewed by physical attendance. Consequently, such work practices can seem outdated, and one should not expect an open space in which your suggestions for better work-life balance will be welcomed.Conversely, if you are aiming to start your own company and retain top talent, it may be a good idea to offer a flexible work culture that suits each individual&amp;rsquo;s desired work-life balance—consider work-from-home days and encourage workplace discussions on how to foster a collaborative work environment. Of course, there are many ways to organize a work culture, but the key consideration is the employee’s wellbeing. If that is taken care of, creativity and productivity naturally follow.Written by Daniel Miller, co-founder of All Hands Taiwan and Taiwan Manager for Pagoda Projects.","tags":[],"categories":[],"href":"/en/why-taiwan/taiwanese-work-culture-four-key-cultural-differences-to-look-out-for/"},{"title":"Taiwan’s Diverse Sports Industry","content":"  Taiwan’s Diverse Sports Industry  Taiwan is a small, but dense island, with a total population of 24 million and land area of approximately 36,000 square kilometers. Though the Taiwanese sports industry is not something extraordinary, in recent years, citizens have started to put more time and effort into physical fitness. The government and private sectors have also begun putting more focus and emphasis on developing the country’s sports industry, causing the industry to grow. Baseball    From CPBL Fan Page    Close           Baseball is often considered as Taiwan’s national sport. Since the Japanese occupation of Taiwan to present day, Taiwan has developed a complete training and league system that has brought about many talented Taiwanese baseball players. Many domestic professional baseball stars and foreign players have come from this long-established system. The Chinese Professional Baseball League is the first professional sports league established in Taiwan. It consists of five organizations, four have teams in the main league, one in the farm league, and has Major (一軍) and Minor (二軍) leagues. Taiwan’s professional baseball leagues utilize methods from different countries as references to better strengthen their program. Should foreign players want to be accepted into the league, they must play at the Triple-A level or have been in the Major Leagues. Basketball     Close           Basketball is another popular sport that the Taiwanese value and enjoy. Currently, Taiwan’s basketball leagues include the newly established professional P.LEAGUE&#43; and the semi-professional Super Basketball League (SBL). The newly formed P.LEAGUE&#43; consists of 4 teams and is set to begin competing in December of 2020. This is Taiwan’s first professional basketball league since the closure of the Chinese Basketball Alliance, which existed between 1994-1999. SBL, Taiwan’s semi-professional basketball league, was founded in 2003, and currently consists of 5 teams, including the Bank of Taiwan, Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology, Taiwan Beer, Taoyuan Pauian Archiland, and Yulon Luxgen Dinos. The season begins in November-December of every year and ends in May. Other Sports    From TESL Website    Close           In addition to professional baseball and basketball leagues, Taiwan also holds well-known sports events such as corporate volleyball competitions and different levels of soccer competitions. In response to the growing popularity of the E-Sports industry, many companies have begun investing resources and holding company sports competitions. The younger generation, especially, has taken an interest in this industry, investing more and more of their time and resources, causing new E-Sports Stars to be born. Endurance Sports    From Taipei Marathon Fan Page    Close           In recent years, more and more Taiwanese are participating in endurance sports events such as marathons and triathlons. It is estimated that Taiwan has hosted approximately 999 endurance sports events in 2019, the highest count in the world. Though 2020 has been a difficult year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan is still able to host large-scale events and competitions with more than 1,000 attendees because of its strict and organized epidemic prevention policies. There are 4 major marathons in Taiwan; New Taipei City Wan Jin Shi Marathon, Taipei International Marathon, Kaohsiung International Marathon, and the Tianzhong Marathon. Each marathon allows participants to fully experience the unique nature and local customs of Taiwan while running, truly one of the best ways to experience and get to know Taiwan.","tags":[],"categories":[],"href":"/en/why-taiwan/taiwans-sports-industry/"},{"title":"Taiwan’s Modern &amp; Contemporary Art Museums","content":"  Taiwan’s Modern &amp;amp; Contemporary Art Museums  Although Taiwan spans a modest 36,000 square kilometers, the island is home to over 220 museums. These range from the globally renowned National Palace Museum, to the lesser-known and quirkier Teng Feng Fish Ball Museum, Miniatures Museum of Taiwan, Taiwan Balloon Museum, and the Republic of Chocolate.In addition to the myriad institutions that highlight the island’s rich and extensive cultural history, Taiwan is also home to several world-class modern and contemporary art museums. With their fingers on the pulse of the contemporary art heartbeat, these museums bring the latest trends and innovations to our front door while amplifying contemporary Taiwanese art on the global stage. Taipei Fine Arts Museum  Taipei   Close           Photo by Wei-Te Wong / CCEstablished in 1983, the Taipei Fine Arts Museum (TFAM) was the first public museum in Taiwan dedicated to modern and contemporary art. Since its inception, it has pioneered the development of fine art on the island and has played a significant role in cultivating public awareness, understanding, and appreciation of art. In addition to organizing exhibitions of both established and rising local artists, TFAM is known for holding large-scale international art exhibitions where visitors can see works by renowned international artists like Andy Warhol, Anish Kapoor, Yayoi Kusama, and more. With the annual Taipei Art Awards, TFAM nurtures and promotes up-and-coming Taiwanese artists, while with the Taipei Biennial, TFAM provides a platform for showcasing the latest and greatest in the global contemporary art scene.On October 4th, 2021, TFAM announced its plan for expansion, which will include the construction of a second museum building that is scheduled to open in 2026.Please visit the official TFAM website  to see their current exhibitions.

The smaller Building 1 was originally constructed in 1931 as the Tainan Police Department, the oldest police station in Taiwan. It was renovated and later re-opened as TNAM in 2018. One year later and one block away, the construction of Building 2 was completed under the direction of award-winning Japanese architect Ban Shigeru. Given its location in Tainan, the historical capital and cultural heart of Taiwan, the TNAM’s foremost objective is to uncover, construct, and activate Taiwan’s local art history and consolidate it into a contemporary cultural identity. The museum’s mission to cultivate art appreciation and cultural value is reflected in its exhibitions, which often explore themes like Taiwanese folk religions and beliefs.Please visit the official TNAM website  to see their current exhibitions. 國立台灣美術館  台中   Close           Photo by Yachuen / CCThe National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts (NTMoFA) is located in the West District of Taichung.

If you’re not familiar with Taiwan, keep reading as we introduce the top six traditional festivals in Taiwan and their respective customs. Before you know it, you will be an expert on Taiwanese culture! Spring Festival (Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year)  Spring Festival is the most important festival and the longest national holiday in Taiwan, beginning on December 30th (New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve) and ending on the fourth day of the first month of the lunar calendar. On the Western calendar, the dates fall around mid-January to mid-February.   Close           There are many traditional customs that must be observed during Spring Festival, and each custom has its own symbolic meaning. One custom that almost every family observes is setting off firecrackers to drive away Nian. According to ancient Chinese folklore, every New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, the beast, Nian, would come out of hiding and wreak havoc in the villages looking for food. The villagers knew that the beast feared the color red and loud noises, so everyone would put red lanterns and spring couplets on their doors and set off firecrackers to deter the beast and scare it away.   Close           On New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, the entire family will clean the house together to welcome in the new year; as the saying goes, “Out with the old, in with the new!” After the cleaning is done, the family will put spring couplets on the door for good luck. At night, the entire family will gather and enjoy New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve dinner. The most common dishes that must be eaten are: fish, special vegetables, dumplings, turnip cake, Buddha jumps over the wall, etc. Each dish is very elaborate and has a special meaning, for example, the Chinese pronunciation for the word “fish” sounds exactly like the word for “abundance”, thus, eating fish symbolizes that you will have a year of abundance. Traditionally, families must not finish the fish entirely, as some must be left for next year. Turnip cakes are also a very popular dish because the word “cake” sounds like the word for “high”, symbolizing good luck and a promotion. Lastly, dumplings are shaped like ancient Chinese currency (yuanbao), so eating them signifies attracting wealth and treasure.   Close           On the first day of the Lunar New Year, you must get up early to set off firecrackers, then pay your respects to your friends and relatives by visiting them at home. You are not allowed to sweep the floor or take out the trash because you risk sweeping away your good fortune. If you accidently break something, you must say suì suì píng ān, which means, may you have peace all year round.The second day of the Lunar New Year is reserved for visiting the in-laws on the wife’s side of the family. Traditionally, when a woman is married, she must live with her husband and his family. On the second day, the husband accompanies his wife to her parents&#39; home for a family reunion, to visit friends and relatives, and to maintain relations.Of all the customs that are observed during the Spring Festival, the most popular among both children and adults is the tradition of red envelopes; also known as New Year’s Money or directly translated, “money for suppressing age”. The pronunciation of the Chinese word “age” and the word for “evil spirits” are the same, therefore, receiving this money indicates suppressing evil spirits and bad luck. Nowadays, it has evolved into the delivery of blessings and good luck to anyone who receives a red envelope. Lantern Festival  The Lantern Festival happens on the first full moon of the Lunar New Year. Traditional customs include carrying paper lanterns, solving riddles written on lanterns and eating tangyuan (glutinous rice balls stuffed with sweet paste made from red bean, sesame, or peanut butter). There are many different lantern festivals all over Taiwan, each with their own respective customs depending on the region and where you are located.   Close            Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival: Every year, both locals and tourists travel to Pingxi to write their prayers or wishes for the coming year on a sky lantern and watch as it slowly floats up to their ancestors and Gods in the heavens. Watching as all the lanterns slowly rise and light up the night sky like stars is a magnificent sight to behold and an event that you must attend if you are lucky enough to be in Pingxi at the right time.    From New Taipei City Government    Close            Tainan Yanshui Beehive Fireworks Festival: According to tradition, the people of Yanshui would pray to Guan Di (Guan Gong), the God of War, for peace and protection. Every year, tourists flock to Tainan to experience the thrill of the beehive firecrackers, which consists of thousands of rockets that ignite at the same time with sparks flying everywhere, creating a loud, bee-like sound. Locals believe that being &amp;ldquo;baptized” by fireworks will ward off calamity and bad luck, and bring good fortune in the new year. Participants are advised to wear several layers of clothing, thick pants, and helmets for their safety and protection.    From Tainan City Government    Close            Taitung Bombing Lord Handan Culture Festival: Legend has it that Lord Handan was the God of Wealth, responsible for managing heaven’s treasury and brings good luck and fortune to those he visits. Lord Handan despised the cold, so whenever he would frequent the villages, the people would throw firecrackers on him to keep him warm. People generally believe that the louder the firecrackers explode, the more prosperous the coming year will be, so wherever Lord Handan goes, a symphony of explosions will follow.    From Taitung County Government    Close            Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day)  Qingming Festival is celebrated on April 5th or 6th of every year, and is one of the few festivals that roughly coincide with the Western calendar. As the festival is close to the Children&amp;rsquo;s Day holiday on April 4th, it is the second longest national holiday in Taiwan, causing many locals to take a continuous holiday of up to five days.On this day, it is customary for Taiwanese families to pay respects and commemorate their ancestors by visiting and cleaning their gravesites. Some families also pray and make ritual offerings by placing traditional food dishes on their ancestor’s grave and burning joss sticks and joss paper to honor them. This festival is also a chance for families to reunite and bond with their living relatives. Some larger family clans even hold special ceremonies of worship for thousands of people on this festival; a magnificent spectacle to behold and portrays the spirit of filial piety and family unity.

According to legend, Qu Yuan opposed the emperor’s decision to ally with the state of Qin and was banished. While in exile, Qu Yuan fell into despair and eventually committed suicide by throwing himself into the river on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar. After his death, the people built boats and raced out onto the river to retrieve his body. His body was never found, so the people dropped zongzi into the river in order to protect it from being eaten by fish and shrimp.   Close           Nowadays, in celebration of Dragon Boat Festival, people will eat zongzi and race dragon boats to honor and commemorate the great Qu Yuan. Other customs also include: hanging mug wort and calamus to ward off evil spirits and cleanse the environment, balancing an egg for good luck, drinking realgar wine and wearing incense sachets to ward off evil and sickness.  From Department of Information and Tourism, Taipei City Government    Close            Qixi Festival (Chinese Valentine’s Day)  While Western countries celebrate Valentine’s Day on February 14th, many Asian countries celebrate this holiday on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar; the day when Niulang (Cowherd) and Zhinü (Weaver Maiden) can meet in heaven.According to ancient Chinese legend, Niulang met Zhinü, the beautiful fairy daughter of the Jade Emperor on earth and immediately fell deeply in love with her. He knew that if he stole her clothes, Zhinü would not be able to return to heaven and must stay with him as his wife. When the Queen Mother discovered that they had been married, she was furious, and with her hairpin she drew a silver river that separated the two star-crossed lovers. However, the Queen Mother eventually took pity on the couple, allowing the magpies to build a bridge of magpies over the silver river for them to meet. Thus, once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, Niulang and Zhinü can be reunited. Mid-Autumn Festival (Moon Festival)  The custom of eating moon cakes on Mid-Autumn Festival is said to have begun in the end of Yuan Dynasty. At this time, the people were tormented by a cruel government, which prompted a nationwide rebellion. Zhu Yuanzhang, the leader of the rebellion, sought to organize an uprising by uniting the resistance groups. However, due to the oppressive presence of the government, it was extremely difficult to pass messages to the resistance. Thus, Zhu Yuanzhang ordered his subordinates to write “Uprising on August 15th” on little slips of paper, stuff them into mooncakes, and distribute them among the resistance forces. On the night of August 15th of the lunar calendar, the rebel armies united for the revolt, and after the success of the rebellion, Zhu Yuanzhang celebrated this victory by eating mooncakes with the soldiers and people.Nowadays, many East Asian countries of celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival by eating mooncakes. In Taiwan, Mid-Autumn is also known as the Barbecue Festival, where in addition to eating moon cakes, barbecuing is also an essential activity. The custom of barbequing was started inadvertently by a barbecue sauce advertisement contest in the 1990s. Now, whenever Mid-Autumn arrives, the streets of Taiwan are filled with the delicious aroma of barbeque and of families eating mooncakes together while admiring the full moon.
